@article{SpectralProbabKimS2008,
  abstract = {A key problem in computational proteomics is distinguishing between correct and false peptide identifications. We argue that evaluating the error rates of peptide identifications is not unlike computing generating functions in combinatorics. We show that the generating functions and their derivatives ( spectral energy and spectral probability) represent new features of tandem mass spectra that, similarly to Delta-scores, significantly improve peptide identifications. Furthermore, the spectral probability provides a rigorous solution to the problem of computing statistical significance of spectral identifications. The spectral energy/probability approach improves the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff of existing MS/MS search tools, addresses the notoriously difficult problem of "one-hit-wonders" in mass spectrometry, and often eliminates the need for decoy database searches. We therefore argue that the generating function approach has the potential to increase the number of peptide identifications in MS/MS searches.},

PWAS aggregates the signal of all variants jointly affecting a protein-coding gene and assesses their overall impact on the protein’s function using machine learning and probabilistic models. Subsequently, it tests whether the gene exhibits functional variability between individuals that correlates with the phenotype of interest. PWAS can capture complex modes of heritability, including recessive inheritance. A comparison with GWAS and other existing methods proves its capacity to recover causal protein-coding genes and highlight new associations. PWAS is available as a command-line tool.</jats:p>},

               <jats:p>One of the most pressing challenges in genomic medicine is to understand the role played by genetic variation in health and disease. Thanks to the exploration of genomic variants at large scale, hundreds of thousands of disease-associated loci have been uncovered. However, the identification of variants of clinical relevance is a significant challenge that requires comprehensive interrogation of previous knowledge and linkage to new experimental results. To assist in this complex task, we created DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org/), a knowledge management platform integrating and standardizing data about disease associated genes and variants from multiple sources, including the scientific literature. DisGeNET covers the full spectrum of human diseases as well as normal and abnormal traits. The current release covers more than 24 000 diseases and traits, 17 000 genes and 117 000 genomic variants. The latest developments of DisGeNET include new sources of data, novel data attributes and prioritization metrics, a redesigned web interface and recently launched APIs. Thanks to the data standardization, the combination of expert curated information with data automatically mined from the scientific literature, and a suite of tools for accessing its publicly available data, DisGeNET is an interoperable resource supporting a variety of applications in genomic medicine and drug R\&amp;D.</jats:p>},

               <jats:p>SwissTargetPrediction is a web tool, on-line since 2014, that aims to predict the most probable protein targets of small molecules. Predictions are based on the similarity principle, through reverse screening. Here, we describe the 2019 version, which represents a major update in terms of underlying data, backend and web interface. The bioactivity data were updated, the model retrained and similarity thresholds redefined. In the new version, the predictions are performed by searching for similar molecules, in 2D and 3D, within a larger collection of 376 342 compounds known to be experimentally active on an extended set of 3068 macromolecular targets. An efficient backend implementation allows to speed up the process that returns results for a druglike molecule on human proteins in 15\textendash 20 s. The refreshed web interface enhances user experience with new features for easy input and improved analysis. Interoperability capacity enables straightforward submission of any input or output molecule to other on-line computer-aided drug design tools, developed by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. High levels of predictive performance were maintained despite more extended biological and chemical spaces to be explored, e.g. achieving at least one correct human target in the top 15 predictions for \&gt;70\% of external compounds. The new SwissTargetPrediction is available free of charge (www.swisstargetprediction.ch).</jats:p>},

This approach helped  intuitive detection of the variables that greatly contributed to the separation  of the samples in the score plot as discriminant or metabolic markers, thereby  allowing rapid annotation of two flavanone derivatives.},

The consensus model shows excellent prediction accuracies on two independent test sets with two cutoffs of 20\% and 50\% for classification of molecules.

Hepatocytes from five individual rats and five individual humans were exposed for 24 h to 11 concentrations of TCDD ranging from 0.00001 to 100nM and a vehicle control. Gene expression changes were analyzed using whole-genome microarrays containing 13,002 orthologs. Significant changes in expression of individual orthologs at any concentration (fold change [FC] {\textdollar \textbackslash pm\textdollar } 1.5 and false discovery rate {\textdollar <\textdollar } 0.05) were higher in the rat (1547) compared with human hepatocytes (475). Only 158 differentially expressed orthologs were common between rats and humans. Enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed orthologs in each species with 49 and 34 enriched human and rat pathways, respectively. Only 12 enriched pathways were shared between the two species. The results demonstrate significant cross-species differences in expression at both the gene and pathway level. Benchmark dose analysis of gene expression changes showed an average 18-fold cross-species difference in potency among differentially expressed orthologs with the rat more sensitive than the human. Similar cross-species differences in potency were observed for signaling pathways. Using the maximum FC in gene expression as a measure of efficacy, the human hepatocytes showed on average a 20\textbackslash \% lower efficacy among the individual orthologs showing differential expression. The results provide evidence for divergent cross-species gene expression changes in response to TCDD and are consistent with epidemiological and clinical evidence showing humans to be less sensitive to TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Nano-flow liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nano-flow LC\textbackslash textendash MS/MS) is the mainstay in proteome research because of its excellent sensitivity but often comes at the expense of robustness. Here we show that micro-flow LC\textbackslash textendash MS/MS using a 1\textbackslash ,\textbackslash texttimes\textbackslash ,150\textbackslash ,mm column shows excellent reproducibility of chromatographic retention time ({\textdollar <\textdollar }0.3\textbackslash \% coefficient of variation, CV) and protein quantification ({\textdollar <\textdollar }7.5\textbackslash \% CV) using data from {\textdollar >\textdollar }2000 samples of human cell lines, tissues and body fluids. Deep proteome analysis identifies {\textdollar >\textdollar }9000 proteins and {\textdollar >\textdollar }120,000 peptides in 16\textbackslash ,h and sample multiplexing using tandem mass tags increases throughput to 11 proteomes in 16\textbackslash ,h. The system identifies {\textdollar >\textdollar }30,000 phosphopeptides in 12\textbackslash ,h and protein-protein or protein-drug interaction experiments can be analyzed in 20\textbackslash ,min per sample. We show that the same column can be used to analyze {\textdollar >\textdollar }7500 samples without apparent loss of performance. This study demonstrates that micro-flow LC\textbackslash textendash MS/MS is suitable for a broad range of proteomic applications.},

  abstract = {Medicinal plants are complex chemical systems containing thousands of secondary metabolites. The rapid classification and characterization of the components in  medicinal plants using mass spectrometry (MS) remains an immense challenge.  Herein, a novel strategy is presented for MS through the combination of  solid-phase extraction (SPE), multiple mass defect filtering (MMDF) and molecular  networking (MN). This strategy enables efficient classification and annotation of  natural products. When combined with SPE and MMDF, the improved analytical method  of MN can perform the rapid annotation of diverse natural products in Citrus  aurantium according to the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragments. In MN,  MS2LDA can be initially applied to recognize substructures of natural products,  according to the common fragmentation patterns and neutral losses in multiple  MS/MS spectra. MolNetEnhancer was adopted here to obtain chemical classifications  provided by ClassyFire. The results suggest that the integrated SPE-MMDF-MN  method was capable of rapidly annotating a greater number of natural products  from Citrus aurantium than the classical MN strategy alone. Moreover, SPE and  MMDF enhanced the effectiveness of MN for annotating, classifying and  distinguishing different types of natural products. Our workflow provides the  foundation for the automated, high-throughput structural classification and  annotation of secondary metabolites with various chemical structures. The  developed approach can be widely applied in the analysis of constituents in  natural products.},

We identify a major shift between mild and moderate disease, at which point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied by the loss of specific classes of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within this stressed plasma environment at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune cell phenotypes emerge and amplify with increasing disease severity. We condensed over 120,000 immune features into a single axis to capture how different immune cell classes coordinate in response to SARS-CoV-2. This immune-response axis independently aligns with the major plasma composition changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that moderate disease may provide the most effective setting for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {Differential expression analysis of genomic data types, such as RNA-sequencing experiments, use linear models to determine the size and direction of the changes in gene expression. For RNA-sequencing, there are several established software packages for this purpose accompanied with analysis pipelines that are well described. However, there are two crucial steps in the analysis process that can be a stumbling block for many -- the set up an appropriate model via design matrices and the set up of comparisons of interest via contrast matrices. These steps are particularly troublesome because an extensive catalogue for design and contrast matrices does not currently exist. One would usually search for example case studies across different platforms and mix and match the advice from those sources to suit the dataset they have at hand. This article guides the reader through the basics of how to set up design and contrast matrices. We take a practical approach by providing code and graphical representation of each case study, starting with simpler examples (e.g. models with a single explanatory variable) and move onto more complex ones (e.g. interaction models, mixed effects models, higher order time series and cyclical models). Although our work has been written specifically with a               limma               -style pipeline in mind, most of it is also applicable to other software packages for differential expression analysis, and the ideas covered can be adapted to data analysis of other high-throughput technologies. Where appropriate, we explain the interpretation and differences between models to aid readers in their own model choices. Unnecessary jargon and theory is omitted where possible so that our work is accessible to a wide audience of readers, from beginners to those with experience in genomics data analysis.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence methods offer exciting new capabilities for the discovery of biological mechanisms from raw data because they are able to detect vastly more complex patterns of association that cannot be captured by classical statistical tests. Among these methods, deep neural networks are currently among the most advanced approaches and, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to perform excellently for a variety of difficult tasks. Despite that applications of this type of networks to high-dimensional omics data and, most importantly, meaningful interpretation of the results returned from such models in a biomedical context remains an open problem. Here we present, an approach applying a CNN to nonimage data for feature selection. Our pipeline, DeepFeature, can both successfully transform omics data into a form that is optimal for fitting a CNN model and can also return sets of the most important genes used internally for computing predictions. Within the framework, the Snowfall compression algorithm is introduced to enable more elements in the fixed pixel framework, and region accumulation and element decoder is developed to find elements or genes from the class activation maps. In comparative tests for cancer type prediction task, DeepFeature simultaneously achieved superior predictive performance and better ability to discover key pathways and biological processes meaningful for this context. Capabilities offered by the proposed framework can enable the effective use of powerful deep learning methods to facilitate the discovery of causal mechanisms in high-dimensional biomedical data.},

  abstract = {Serum lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is described to decline in patients with chronic liver diseases. Here it was evaluated which of the LPC species are associated with liver function. LPC species were quantified by direct flow-injection electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in serum of 45 patients with mainly alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC is 52.1 (31.7-110.0) {\textdollar \textbackslash mu\textdollar }mol/l in serum of patients with CHILD-PUGH score C (decompensated liver cirrhosis) and significantly lower compared to patients with well-compensated disease (CHILD-PUGH score A) with 114.1 (12.3-401.4) {\textdollar \textbackslash mu\textdollar }mol/l. Mono- and polyunsaturated LPC are not changed in these groups. Saturated LPC is negatively correlated with the model for end-stage liver disease score, bilirubin and galectin-3 and positively with Quick prothrombin time. Ascites and varices are complications of liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC does, however, not correlate with hepatic venous pressure gradient, ascites volume and variceal size. Unexpectedly, saturated LPC measured in serum of 42 patients declines from 88.4 (27.8-177.5) {\textdollar \textbackslash mu\textdollar }mol/l to 72.4 (27.6-141.8) {\textdollar \textbackslash mu\textdollar }mol/l shortly after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt implantation. Hepatic vein saturated LPC (82.3 (12.4-161.7) {\textdollar \textbackslash mu\textdollar }mol/l) is higher than portal vein levels (78.8 (10.1-161.0) {\textdollar \textbackslash mu\textdollar }mol/l) suggesting hepatic release of this lipid species. Current data demonstrate that systemic saturated LPC species are reduced in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and associated with mortality risk.},

Accumulating evidence indicates that the proteasome, a large multisubunit protein deg radative machine in eukaryotes, functions as a processing enzyme responsible for the generation of MHC class I ligands. This processing system is elaborately regulated by various immunomodulatory cytokines. In particular, interferon-gamma induces the formation of immunoproteasomes and a recently identified proteasomal regulatory factor.

Many of the MHC-encoded genes including LMP appear to have emerged by an ancient chromosomal duplication, suggesting that modifications and renewal of pre-existing non-immune genes were instrumental in the emergence of adaptive immunity.},

  abstract = {Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and conjugated linolenic acids (CLNAs) have gained significant attention due to their anticarcinogenic and lipid/energy metabolism-modulatory effects. However, their concentration in foodstuffs is insufficient for any therapeutic application to be implemented. From a biotechnological standpoint, microbial production of these conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) has been explored as an alternative, and strains of the genera Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium have shown promising producing capacities. Current screening research works are generally based on direct analytical determination of production capacity (e.g., trial and error), representing an important bottleneck in these studies. This review aims to summarize the available information regarding identified genes and proteins involved in CLA/CLNA production by these groups of bacteria and, consequently, the possible enzymatic reactions behind such metabolic processes. Linoleate isomerase (LAI) was the first enzyme to be described to be involved in the microbiological transformation of linoleic acids (LAs) and linolenic acids (LNAs) into CFA isomers. Thus, the availability of lai gene sequences has allowed the development of genetic screening tools. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that LAIs have significant homology with myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) proteins, which are involved in the synthesis of hydroxy fatty acids, as shown by hydratase activity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that CLA and/or CLNA production results from a stress response performed by the activation of more than one gene in a multiple-step reaction. Studies on CFA biochemical pathways are essential to understand and characterize the metabolic mechanism behind this process, unraveling all the gene products that may be involved. As some of these bacteria have shown modulation of lipid metabolism in vivo, further research to be focused on this topic may help us to understand the role of the gut microbiota in human health.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be used to infer causal relationships between phenotypes, using a strategy known as 2-sample Mendelian randomization (2SMR) and bypassing the need for individual-level data. However, 2SMR methods are evolving rapidly and GWAS results are often insufficiently curated, undermining efficient implementation of the approach. We therefore developed MR-Base (<jats:ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrbase.org">http://www.mrbase.org</jats:ext-link>): a platform that integrates a curated database of complete GWAS results (no restrictions according to statistical significance) with an application programming interface, web app and R packages that automate 2SMR. The software includes several sensitivity analyses for assessing the impact of horizontal pleiotropy and other violations of assumptions. The database currently comprises 11 billion single nucleotide polymorphism-trait associations from 1673 GWAS and is updated on a regular basis. Integrating data with software ensures more rigorous application of hypothesis-driven analyses and allows millions of potential causal relationships to be efficiently evaluated in phenome-wide association studies.</jats:p>},

               <jats:p>MusiteDeep is an online resource providing a deep-learning framework for protein post-translational modification (PTM) site prediction and visualization. The predictor only uses protein sequences as input and no complex features are needed, which results in a real-time prediction for a large number of proteins. It takes less than three minutes to predict for 1000 sequences per PTM type. The output is presented at the amino acid level for the user-selected PTM types. The framework has been benchmarked and has demonstrated competitive performance in PTM site predictions by other researchers. In this webserver, we updated the previous framework by utilizing more advanced ensemble techniques, and providing prediction and visualization for multiple PTMs simultaneously for users to analyze potential PTM cross-talks directly. Besides prediction, users can interactively review the predicted PTM sites in the context of known PTM annotations and protein 3D structures through homology-based search. In addition, the server maintains a local database providing pre-processed PTM annotations from Uniport/Swiss-Prot for users to download. This database will be updated every three months. The MusiteDeep server is available at https://www.musite.net. The stand-alone tools for locally using MusiteDeep are available at https://github.com/duolinwang/MusiteDeep\_web.</jats:p>},

               <jats:p>Pharmacotranscriptomics has become a powerful approach for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of drugs and discovering new drug targets. Recently, studies of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have increasingly turned to high-throughput transcriptomic screens for molecular effects of herbs/ingredients. And numerous studies have examined gene targets for herbs/ingredients, and link herbs/ingredients to various modern diseases. However, there is currently no systematic database organizing these data for TCM. Therefore, we built HERB, a high-throughput experiment- and reference-guided database of TCM, with its Chinese name as BenCaoZuJian. We re-analyzed 6164 gene expression profiles from 1037 high-throughput experiments evaluating TCM herbs/ingredients, and generated connections between TCM herbs/ingredients and 2837 modern drugs by mapping the comprehensive pharmacotranscriptomics dataset in HERB to CMap, the largest such dataset for modern drugs. Moreover, we manually curated 1241 gene targets and 494 modern diseases for 473 herbs/ingredients from 1966 references published recently, and cross-referenced this novel information to databases containing such data for drugs. Together with database mining and statistical inference, we linked 12 933 targets and 28 212 diseases to 7263 herbs and 49 258 ingredients and provided six pairwise relationships among them in HERB. In summary, HERB will intensively support the modernization of TCM and guide rational modern drug discovery efforts. And it is accessible through http://herb.ac.cn/.</jats:p>},

Herein, we performed multi-platform omics analysis of serial plasma and urine samples collected from patients during the course of COVID-19. Integrative analyses of these omics data revealed several potential therapeutic targets, such as ANXA1 and CLEC3B. Molecular changes in plasma indicated dysregulation of macrophage and suppression of T cell functions in severe patients compared to those in non-severe patients. Further, we chose 25 important molecular signatures as potential biomarkers for the prediction of disease severity. The prediction power was validated using corresponding urine samples and plasma samples from new COVID-19 patient cohort, with AUC reached to 0.904 and 0.988, respectively. In conclusion, our omics data proposed not only potential therapeutic targets, but also biomarkers for understanding the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.},

While the role of TGR5 signaling in immune cells, adipocytes and enteroendocrine L cells in metabolic regulation has been well described and extensively reviewed, the impact of TGR5-mediated effects on hepatic physiology and pathophysiology in metabolic regulation has received less attention. Recent studies suggest that TGR5 signaling contributes to improvements in hepatic insulin signaling and decreased hepatic inflammation, as well as metabolically beneficial improvements in bile acid profile. Additionally, TGR5 signaling has been associated with reduced hepatic steatosis and liver fibrosis, and improved liver function. Despite the beneficial effects of TGR5 signaling on metabolic health, TGR5-mediated gallstone formation and gallbladder filling complicate therapeutic targeting of TGR5 signaling. To this end, there is a growing need to identify cell type-specific effects of hepatic TGR5 signaling to begin to identify and target the downstream effectors of TGR5 signaling. Herein, we describe and integrate recent advances in our understanding of the impact of TGR5 signaling on liver physiology and how its effects on the liver integrate more broadly with whole body glucose regulation.</jats:p>},

@article{LipotoxicityAnMarra2018,
  abstract = {The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype characterised by hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and fibrosis is still incompletely understood. Herein, we discuss two pivotal aspects of the pathogenesis of NASH. We first analyse the initial mechanisms responsible for hepatocellular damage and inflammation, which derive from the toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in hepatocytes is not the major determinant of lipotoxicity, and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents on liver cells. In particular, the role of free fatty acids such as palmitic acid, cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine and ceramides has recently emerged. These lipotoxic agents affect the cell behaviour via multiple mechanisms, including activation of signalling cascades and death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. In the second part of this review, the cellular and molecular players involved in the cross-talk between the gut and the liver are considered. These include modifications to the microbiota, which provide signals through the intestine and bacterial products, as well as hormones produced in the bowel that affect metabolism at different levels including the liver. Finally, the activation of nuclear receptors by bile acids is analysed.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are known to act as important regulators of the microRNA (miRNA) activity. Yet, computational resources to identify miRNA:circRNA interactions are mostly limited to already annotated circRNAs or affected by high rates of false positive predictions. To overcome these limitations, we developed Circr, a computational tool for the prediction of associations between circRNAs and miRNAs. Circr combines three publicly available algorithms for <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> prediction of miRNA binding sites on target sequences (miRanda, RNAhybrid, and TargetScan) and annotates each identified miRNA:target pairs with experimentally validated miRNA:RNA interactions and binding sites for Argonaute proteins derived from either ChIPseq or CLIPseq data. The combination of multiple tools for the identification of a single miRNA recognition site with experimental data allows to efficiently prioritize candidate miRNA:circRNA interactions for functional studies in different organisms. Circr can use its internal annotation database or custom annotation tables to enhance the identification of novel and not previously annotated miRNA:circRNA sites in virtually any species.

The electrophysiologic basis for these dysrhythmias appears to be heterogeneity of electrical recovery resulting in reentry or enhanced ventricular automaticity. Although the precise mechanisms are unknown, rapid changes in K+, PCO2 and intracellular Ca++ appear to play major roles. In addition, alterations in the regional concentration or tissue compartment localization of amphiphilic lipid metabolites such as lysophosphoglycerides and long-chain acyl carnitines may affect not only the development of dysrhythmia during reperfusion, but also the salvage of ischemic myocardium. Recent experimental evidence in several species also suggests a prominent role of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the evolution of dysrhythmia associated with reperfusion.},

@article{BileAcidSignaLiTi2014,
  abstract = {Bile acids are the end products of cholesterol catabolism. Hepatic bile acid synthesis accounts for a major fraction of daily cholesterol turnover in humans. Biliary secretion of bile acids generates bile flow and facilitates hepatobiliary secretion of lipids, lipophilic metabolites, and xenobiotics. In the intestine, bile acids are essential for the absorption, transport, and metabolism of dietary fats and lipid-soluble vitamins. Extensive research in the last 2 decades has unveiled new functions of bile acids as signaling molecules and metabolic integrators. The bile acid-activated nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, vitamin D receptor, and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor play critical roles in the regulation of lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism, inflammation, and drug metabolism and detoxification. Bile acid synthesis exhibits a strong diurnal rhythm, which is entrained by fasting and refeeding as well as nutrient status and plays an important role for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Recent research revealed an interaction of liver bile acids and gut microbiota in the regulation of liver metabolism. Circadian disturbance and altered gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and obesity. Bile acids and their derivatives are potential therapeutic agents for treating metabolic diseases of the liver.},

In this  study, the secondary metabolites of root, stem, leaf, and flower of I. nervosa  Wall. were visualized using Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking  (GNPS), MolNetEnhancer, XCMS(xcmsonline.scripps.edu) analysis, and \textasciigrave ili mapping  based on high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  (HPLC-MS/MS) data to reveal their chemical differences. Among the 11 kinds of  chemical repertoires annotated by MolNetEnhancer and 16 hits against the GNPS  library, 10-isobutyryloxy-8,9-epoxythymol isobutyrate (1) was revealed as the  most dominant and responsible marker between the roots and the other parts.  Moreover, a battery of unique MS features as well as differential markers were  discovered from different parts of the plant. The chemical differences contribute  to the bioactivity differences, which presented in the  2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH)assay and H(2)O(2)-insulted HepG2 cells and  were in significant correlations with the contents of 1. real-time reverse  transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)results demonstrated that I.  nervosa Wall. extracts upregulated the mRNA expression of nuclear factor  E2-related factor 2(Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1(HO-1), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase  1 (NQO1), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and glutamate-cysteine ligase  catalytic subunit (GCLC) actors involved in antioxidative response in  H(2)O(2)-challenged HepG2 cells. These findings support the roots of I. nervosa  Wall. as active parts of Xiaoheiyao, and also indicate the potential antioxidant  activities of other parts.},

Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem MS to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. We present a method for searching molecular structure databases using tandem MS data of small molecules. Our method computes a fragmentation tree that best explains the fragmentation spectrum of an unknown molecule. We use the fragmentation tree to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine learning. This fingerprint is then used to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem.

It is an extremely challenging problem, and current rule-based and deep-learning methods cannot achieve satisfactory recognition rates. Herein, we propose SwinOCSR, an end-to-end model based on a Swin Transformer. This model uses the Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract image features and introduces Transformer models to convert chemical information from publications into DeepSMILES. A novel chemical structure dataset was constructed to train and verify our method. Our proposed Swin Transformer-based model was extensively tested against the backbone of existing publicly available deep learning methods. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the compared methods, demonstrating the model\textquotesingle s effectiveness. Moreover, we used a focal loss to address the token imbalance problem in the text representation of the chemical structure diagram, and our model achieved an accuracy of 98.58\textbackslash \%.},

@article{ScorpionicidalBrites2021,
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Urban pests pose enormous risks to human health. Control initiatives are carried out in regions of high infestation and incidence of  accidents caused by scorpions OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to analyze the  anti-scorpionic activity of fungal isolates obtained from a cemetery in Brazil.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of thirteen fungi were subjected to a bioassay  test against Tityus serrulatus, and the two isolates with the highest  scorpionicidal activity were selected for molecular identification through  sequencing of the ITS DNA hypervariable region and large-scale cultivation on  liquid medium for secondary metabolite extraction. The crude extracts were  partitioned by solid-phase extraction, and the resulting purified extracts were  tested for anti-scorpionic activity. The extracts from one of the isolates  presented better results and were submitted to UPLC-MS/MS. The metabolomics data  were submitted to GNPS website for Molecular Networking and MASST searches. We  also performed a MolNetEnhancer analysis to identify the chemical classes of the  molecules found in the samples. RESULTS: The most promising fungal isolate was  identified as Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 which has 98\textbackslash \% of similarity to  Paecilomyces formosus. The sub-fractions C and D had the best activity against  the scorpions (54 and 32\textbackslash \% mortality, respectively). Molecular Networking and  MolNetEnhancer revealed a range of molecular classes in our extracts that are  known to include bioactive metabolites from Paecilomyces species. CONCLUSIONS:  The scorpionicidal activity of Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 and its secondary  metabolites may provide new alternative compounds for biological and chemical  control of scorpions from the species T. serrulatus. Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 is  an isolate that has great potential for isolation of secondary metabolites.},

@article{ExploringOpenShaB2019,
  abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large and diverse class of chemicals of great interest due to their wide commercial applicability, as well  as increasing public concern regarding their adverse impacts. A common  terminology for PFASs was recommended in 2011, including broad categorization and  detailed naming for many PFASs with rather simple molecular structures. Recent  advancements in chemical analysis have enabled identification of a wide variety  of PFASs that are not covered by this common terminology. The resulting  inconsistency in categorizing and naming of PFASs is preventing efficient  assimilation of reported information. This article explores how a combination of  expert knowledge and cheminformatics approaches could help address this challenge  in a systematic manner. First, the "splitPFAS" approach was developed to  systematically subdivide PFASs (for eventual categorization) following a  C(n)F(2n+1)-X-R pattern into their various parts, with a particular focus on 4  PFAS categories where X is CO, SO(2), CH(2) and CH(2)CH(2). Then, the open,  ontology-based "ClassyFire" approach was tested for potential applicability to  categorizing and naming PFASs using five scenarios of original and simplified  structures based on the "splitPFAS" output. This workflow was applied to a set of  770 PFASs from the latest OECD PFAS list. While splitPFAS categorized PFASs as  intended, the ClassyFire results were mixed. These results reveal that open  cheminformatics approaches have the potential to assist in categorizing PFASs in  a consistent manner, while much development is needed for future systematic  naming of PFASs. The "splitPFAS" tool and related code are publicly available,  and include options to extend this proof-of-concept to encompass further PFASs in  the future.},

  abstract = {We introduce a novel Bayesian probabilistic peak detection algorithm for liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The final probabilistic result allows the user to make a final decision about which points in a chromatogram are affected by a chromatographic peak and which ones are only affected by noise. The use of probabilities contrasts with the traditional method in which a binary answer is given, relying on a threshold. By contrast, with the Bayesian peak detection presented here, the values of probability can be further propagated into other preprocessing steps, which will increase (or decrease) the importance of chromatographic regions into the final results. The present work is based on the use of the statistical overlap theory of component overlap from Davis and Giddings (Davis, J. M.; Giddings, J. Anal. Chem. 1983, 55, 418-424) as prior probability in the Bayesian formulation. The algorithm was tested on LC-MS Orbitrap data and was able to successfully distinguish chemical noise from actual peaks without any data preprocessing.},

Still, the identification of non-tryptic peptides presents substantial computational challenges. To address these, we synthesized and analyzed {\textdollar >\textdollar }300,000 peptides by multi-modal LC-MS/MS within the ProteomeTools project representing HLA class I \textbackslash \& II ligands and products of the proteases AspN and LysN. The resulting data enabled training of a single model using the deep learning framework Prosit, allowing the accurate prediction of fragment ion spectra for tryptic and non-tryptic peptides. Applying Prosit demonstrates that the identification of HLA peptides can be improved up to 7-fold, that 87\textbackslash \% of the proposed proteasomally spliced HLA peptides may be incorrect and that dozens of additional immunogenic neo-epitopes can be identified from patient tumors in published data. Together, the provided peptides, spectra and computational tools substantially expand the analytical depth of immunopeptidomics workflows.},

  abstract = {Astrocytes have important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) during health and disease. Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-Is) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered interferon (IFN)-{\textdollar \textbackslash beta\textdollar } are partly mediated by AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AHR agonists that have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate, indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde, or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AHR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-Is produced in the CNS function in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AHR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.},

Accordingly, IFN-{\textdollar \textbackslash gamma\textdollar } abrogates endotoxin tolerance, a major negative feedback loop that silences expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in macrophages previously exposed to endotoxin/Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Mechanisms by which IFN-{\textdollar \textbackslash gamma\textdollar } inhibits endotoxin tolerance have not been elucidated. Here, we show that pretreatment with IFN-{\textdollar \textbackslash gamma\textdollar } prevented tolerization of primary human monocytes and restored TLR4-mediated induction of various proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF{\textdollar \textbackslash alpha\textdollar }. Surprisingly, IFN-{\textdollar \textbackslash gamma\textdollar } did not alter proximal TLR4 signaling defects in tolerized monocytes. Instead, IFN-{\textdollar \textbackslash gamma\textdollar } blocked tolerance-associated down-regulation of               IL6               and               TNF               transcription, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and NF-{\textdollar \textbackslash kappa\textdollar }B and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein {\textdollar \textbackslash beta\textdollar } transcription factor binding to the               IL6               and               TNF               promoters in tolerized monocytes. The mechanism by which IFN-{\textdollar \textbackslash gamma\textdollar } restored               IL6               expression was by facilitating TLR4-induced recruitment of chromatin remodeling machinery to the               IL6               promoter and promoting               IL6               locus accessibility in tolerized monocytes. Our results suggest that IFN-{\textdollar \textbackslash gamma\textdollar } overcomes endotoxin tolerance by facilitating TLR-induced chromatin remodeling to allow expression of proinflammatory genes. These results identify a mechanism by which IFN-{\textdollar \textbackslash gamma\textdollar } promotes activation of macrophages and highlight the importance of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional control in the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production in tolerant and activated macrophages.},

  abstract = {  Hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEEs) are critical building blocks of many modern applications. However, they have a one-way isolation model that introduces a semantic gap between a TEE and its outside world. This lack of information causes an ever-increasing set of attacks on TEE-enabled applications that exploit various insecure interactions with the host OSs, applications, or other enclaves. We introduce Sirius, the first compartmentalization framework that achieves strong isolation and secure sharing in TEE-assisted applications by controlling the dataflows within primary kernel objects (e.g. threads, processes, address spaces, files, sockets, pipes) in both the secure and normal worlds. Sirius replaces ad-hoc interactions in current TEE systems with a principled approach that adds strong inter- and intra-address space isolation and effectively eliminates a wide range of attacks. We evaluate Sirius on ARM platforms and find that it is lightweight (\textdollar \textbackslash approx 15K\textdollar  LoC) and only adds \textdollar \textbackslash approx 10.8\textbackslash \%\textdollar  overhead to enable TEE support on applications such as httpd, and improves the performance of existing TEE-enabled applications such as the Darknet ML framework and ARM\textquotesingle s LibDDSSec by \textdollar 0.05\textbackslash \%-5.6\textbackslash \%\textdollar . },

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to integrate two areas in recent clinical theory, research, and practice: family accommodation and non-violent resistance (NVR). Family accommodation describes changes that family members make to their own behavior, to help their relative who is dealing with psychopathology to avoid or alleviate distress related to the disorder. Rapidly growing research on family accommodation has established its high prevalence and negative impact across disorders and the life span. NVR is a trans-diagnostic treatment approach that helps parents to cope with child externalizing, internalizing, and other problems in non-escalatory ways. This study reviews empirical research on family accommodation and NVR, and argues that the anchoring function of NVR, a central concept reflecting the stabilization of the parent-child relationship, may provide a uniquely suited framework for reducing family accommodation across disorders and development. The study discusses how the anchoring function may be applied to promote accommodation reduction through a detailed description of SPACE (Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions), an NVR-informed treatment for childhood anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.},

Our benchmarks show that elPrep 5 speeds up the runtime of the variant calling pipeline by a factor 8-16x on both whole-exome and whole-genome data while using the same hardware resources as GATK4. This makes elPrep 5 a suitable drop-in replacement for GATK4 when faster execution times are needed.},

  abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Metabolite identification is an important task in metabolomics to enhance the knowledge of biological systems. There have been a number of machine learning-based methods proposed for this task, which predict a chemical structure of a given spectrum through an intermediate (chemical structure) representation called molecular fingerprints. They usually have two steps: (i) predicting fingerprints from spectra; (ii) searching chemical compounds (in database) corresponding to the predicted fingerprints. Fingerprints are feature vectors, which are usually very large to cover all possible substructures and chemical properties, and therefore heavily redundant, in the sense of having many molecular (sub)structures irrelevant to the task, causing limited predictive performance and slow prediction.                                         Results               We propose ADAPTIVE, which has two parts: learning two mappings (i) from structures to molecular vectors and (ii) from spectra to molecular vectors. The first part learns molecular vectors for metabolites from given data, to be consistent with both spectra and chemical structures of metabolites. In more detail, molecular vectors are generated by a model, being parameterized by a message passing neural network, and parameters are estimated by maximizing the correlation between molecular vectors and the corresponding spectra in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Molecular vectors generated by this model are compact and importantly adaptive (specific) to both given data and task of metabolite identification. The second part uses input output kernel regression (IOKR), the current cutting-edge method of metabolite identification. We empirically confirmed the effectiveness of ADAPTIVE by using a benchmark data, where ADAPTIVE outperformed the original IOKR in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pathogenesis and diagnostic biomarkers for diseases can be discovered by metabolomic profiling of human fluids. If the various types of coronary artery disease (CAD) can be accurately characterized by metabolomics, effective treatment may be targeted without using unnecessary therapies and resources. OBJECTIVES The authors studied disturbed metabolic pathways to assess the diagnostic value of metabolomics-based biomarkers in different types of CAD. METHODS A cohort of 2,324 patients from 4 independent centers was studied. Patients underwent coronary angiography for suspected CAD. Groups were divided as follows: normal coronary artery (NCA), nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis (NOCA), stable angina (SA), unstable angina (UA), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Plasma metabolomic profiles were determined by liquid chromatography\textbackslash textendash quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and were analyzed by multivariate statistics. RESULTS We made 12 cross-comparisons to and within CAD to characterize metabolic disturbances. We focused on comparisons of NOCA versus NCA, SA versus NOCA, UA versus SA, and AMI versus UA. Other comparisons were made, including SA versus NCA, UA versus NCA, AMI versus NCA, UA versus NOCA, AMI versus NOCA, AMI versus SA, significant CAD (SA/UA/AMI) versus nonsignificant CAD (NCA/NOCA), and acute coronary syndrome (UA/AMI) versus SA. A total of 89 differential metabolites were identified. The altered metabolic pathways included reduced phospholipid catabolism, increased amino acid metabolism, increased short-chain acylcarnitines, decrease in tricarboxylic acid cycle, and less biosynthesis of primary bile acid. For differential diagnosis, 12 panels of specific metabolomics-based biomarkers provided areas under the curve of 0.938 to 0.996 in the discovery phase (n {\textdollar \textbackslash frac{1}{4}\textdollar } 1,086), predictive values of 89.2\textbackslash \% to 96.0\textbackslash \% in the test phase (n {\textdollar \textbackslash frac{1}{4}\textdollar } 933), and 85.3\textbackslash \% to 96.4\textbackslash \% in the 3-center external sets (n {\textdollar \textbackslash frac{1}{4}\textdollar } 305). CONCLUSIONS Plasma metabolomics are powerful for characterizing metabolic disturbances. Differences in small-molecule metabolites may reflect underlying CAD and serve as biomarkers for CAD progression.

This has been fuelled by interest in the  central role that microorganisms play in mediating both interspecies interactions  and host-microbe relationships. To support the study of natural products  chemistry produced by microorganisms we released the Natural Products Atlas, a  database of known microbial natural products structures, in 2019. This paper  reports the release of a new version of the database which includes a full  RESTful application programming interface (API), a new website framework, and an  expanded database that includes 8128 new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552.  In addition to these structural and content changes we have added full taxonomic  descriptions for all microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from  both NP Classifier and ClassyFire. We have also performed manual curation to  review all entries with incomplete configurational assignments and have  integrated data from external resources, including CyanoMetDB. Finally, we have  improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a  dashboard for taxonomic origin. The database can be accessed via the new  interactive website at https://www.npatlas.org.},

Here we derive a mathematical expression to compute PrediXcan (a gene mapping approach) results using summary data (S-PrediXcan) and show its accuracy and general robustness to misspecified reference sets. We apply this framework to 44 GTEx tissues and 100+ phenotypes from GWAS and meta-analysis studies, creating a growing public catalog of associations that seeks to capture the effects of gene expression variation on human phenotypes. Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations are tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology. Colocalized significant associations in unexpected tissues underscore the need for an agnostic scanning of multiple contexts to improve our ability to detect causal regulatory mechanisms. Monogenic disease genes are enriched among significant associations for related traits, suggesting that smaller alterations of these genes may cause a spectrum of milder phenotypes.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are classified according to their histological features. Accurate classification of RCC and comprehensive understanding of their metabolic dysregulation are of critical importance. Here we investigate the use of metabolomic analyses to classify the main RCC subtypes and to describe the metabolic variation for each subtype. To this end, we performed metabolomic profiling of 65 RCC frozen samples (40 clear cell, 14 papillary and 11 chromophobe) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. OPLS-DA multivariate analysis based on metabolomic data showed clear discrimination of all three main subtypes of RCC (R               2               \textbackslash ,=\textbackslash ,75.0\textbackslash \%, Q               2               \textbackslash ,=\textbackslash ,59.7\textbackslash \%). The prognostic performance was evaluated using an independent cohort and showed an AUROC of 0.924, 0.991 and 1 for clear cell, papillary and chromophobe RCC, respectively. Further pathway analysis using the 21 top metabolites showed significant differences in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism between three RCC subtypes. In conclusion, this study shows that metabolomic profiling could serve as a tool that is complementary to histology for RCC subtype classification. An overview of metabolic dysregulation in RCC subtypes was established giving new insights into the understanding of their clinical behaviour and for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased de novo lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid {\textdollar \textbackslash beta\textdollar }-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs ex vivo in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides-Dipsaci Radix (EU-DR) is a commonly used herbal pair for the treatment of osteoporosis (OP) in China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential mechanism of EU-DR on OP through network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches. Combining data from multiple open-source databases and literature mining, the active compounds and potential targets of EU-DR were screened out. The OP related targets were identified from the interactive web tool GEO2R. The shared targets were obtained by intersecting the targets of EU-DR and OP. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed via the STRING database and Cytoscape 3.7.2 software. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were conducted using R 3.6.3 software with adjusted p-value {\textdollar <\textdollar } 0.05. Sybyl-x 2.1.1 and Autodock Vina 1.1.2 software were used to cross validate the affinity between active compounds and target proteins. Our results showed that a total of 50 active compounds were screened, corresponding to 895 EU-DR targets, 2202 OP targets and 144 shared targets. The flavonoids in EU-DR played an important role in anti-OP. The enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG suggested EU-DR exerted a therapeutic effect on OP mainly by regulating the osteoclast differentiation related signaling pathway. Meanwhile, molecular docking results showed that most active compounds in EU-DR had strong binding efficiency to the target proteins. In conclusion, this study elaborated the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway interaction mechanism of the EU-DR herbal pair in the treatment of OP for the first time, which also provided a pharmacological basis for treating OP.},

@article{PropagatingAnnDaSil2018,
  abstract = {The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of in silico predictions. One of the challenges of in silico annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of in silico predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve in silico annotations. The Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) tool is accessible through the GNPS web-platform https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-theoretical.jsp.},

Main funding source(s): The National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China                                         Background               \textasciitilde Acute heart failure (AHF) is a significant public health problem related to the high mortality and rehospitalization rate of patients. Although drug development is never interrupted, no single drug has been proven to play a decisive role in improving the survival of AHF patients. In China, multi-component traditional Chinese medicine\textasciitilde has been widely\textasciitilde used to treat AHF. As a Chinese herbal injection included in medical insurance, Yiqi Fumai Injection can reduce the level of NT-proBNP in AHF patients, improve heart function, and alleviate symptoms and signs related to heart failure. To further evaluate the therapeutic effect of Yiqi Fumai Injection on AHF, a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial that intends to recruit 1270 patients is being carried out in China. However, the mechanism of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF has not been clarified. To further explore\textasciitilde the underlying mechanism, we used\textasciitilde systematic pharmacology methods to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of biologically active compounds.                                         Methods               \textasciitilde We used the databases of HERB, the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM), the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and GeneCards to predict the active ingredients and potential targets of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF. STRING was used for PPI network construction and analysis. Cytoscape was used to build a network between Chinese medicine, ingredients and targets. The DAVID, GO, and KEGG databases were used to predict the potential pathways of Yiqi Fumai Injection for the treatment of AHF.                                         Results               \textasciitilde We obtained 31 active compounds of Yiqi Fumai Injection from HERB and ECTM databases. By overlapping targets between YQFMI and AHF, a total of 240 potential targets for Yiqi Fumai Injection to treat AHF were selected.\textasciitilde According to the H-C-T network topology analysis, the core compounds include beta-sitosterol, Uridine, Guanosine, and Stigmasterol. Sixteen protein targets had significantly higher node degrees than the average in the PPI network, including AKT1, JUN, TNF, EDN1, CASP3, ESR1, DLG4, PTGS2, NOS3, IL1B, C3, AR, LEP, CNR1, CHRM2, and DRD2. The PPI results showed that the potential therapeutic targets of YQFMI were densely enriched in pathways related to endothelial function, neuromodulation, and lipid metabolism.The same results were shown in GO and KEGG pathway enrichment.                                         Conclusion               \textasciitilde Our results indicate that Yiqi Fumai Injection may achieve the goal of improving AHF-related symptoms by regulating the function of vascular endothelium and nerves and the biosynthetic pathway of lipid metabolism. These findings support previous studies and provide a reference for studying the mechanism of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF. Abstract Figure.},

               <jats:p>Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and it is characterized by mesangial IgA deposition. Asymptomatic hematuria with various degrees of proteinuria is the most common clinical presentation and up to 20\%\textendash 40\% of patients develop end-stage kidney disease within 20 years after disease onset. The pathogenesis of IgAN involves four sequential processes known as the \textquotedblleft four-hit hypothesis\textquotedblright  which starts with the production of a galactose-deficient IgA1 (gd-IgA1), followed by the formation of anti-gd-IgA1 IgG or IgA1 autoantibodies and immune complexes that ultimately deposit in the glomerular mesangium, leading to inflammation and injury. Although several key questions about the production of gd-IgA1 and the formation of anti-gd-IgA1 antibodies remain unanswered, a growing body of evidence is shedding light on the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms involved in this complex pathogenic process. Herein, we will focus on these mechanisms that, along with genetic and environmental factors, are thought to play a key role in disease pathogenesis.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of serial lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) measurement on 28-day mortality prediction in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of 74 ICU patients in a tertiary hospital. Serum LPC, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured at baseline (day 1 of enrollment) and day 7. The LPC concentrations were compared with inflammatory markers using their absolute levels and relative changes. RESULTS: The LPC concentration on day 7 was significantly lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors (68.45 {\textdollar \textbackslash pm\textdollar } 42.36 {\textdollar \textbackslash mu\textdollar }mol/L and 99.76 {\textdollar \textbackslash pm\textdollar } 73.65 {\textdollar \textbackslash mu\textdollar }mol/L; P = .04). A decreased LPC concentration on day 7 to its baseline as well as a sustained high concentration of PCT on day 7 at more than 50\textbackslash \% of its baseline value was useful for predicting the 28-day mortality. Prognostic utility was substantially improved when combined LPC and PCT criteria were applied to 28-day mortality outcome predictions. Furthermore, LPC concentrations increased over time in patients with appropriate antibiotics but not in those with inappropriate antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurements of LPC help in the prediction of 28-day mortality in ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In order to correctly decode phenotypic information from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, careful selection of the RNA-seq quantification measure is critical for inter-sample comparisons and for downstream analyses, such as differential gene expression between two or more conditions. Several methods have been proposed and continue to be used. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the best gene expression quantification method for RNA-seq data analysis.                                         Methods               In the present study, we used replicate samples from each of 20 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models spanning 15 tumor types, for a total of 61 human tumor xenograft samples available through the NCI patient-derived model repository (PDMR). We compared the reproducibility across replicate samples based on TPM (transcripts per million), FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped), and normalized counts using coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and cluster analysis.                                         Results               Our results revealed that hierarchical clustering on normalized count data tended to group replicate samples from the same PDX model together more accurately than TPM and FPKM data. Furthermore, normalized count data were observed to have the lowest median coefficient of variation (CV), and highest intraclass correlation (ICC) values across all replicate samples from the same model and for the same gene across all PDX models compared to TPM and FPKM data.                                         Conclusion               We provided compelling evidence for a preferred quantification measure to conduct downstream analyses of PDX RNA-seq data. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of RNA-seq data quantification measures conducted on PDX models, which are known to be inherently more variable than cell line models. Our findings are consistent with what others have shown for human tumors and cell lines and add further support to the thesis that normalized counts are the best choice for the analysis of RNA-seq data across samples.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities, including the deficiencies in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) and glutathione metabolism. Here it is investigated if administration of a mixture of combined metabolic activators (CMAs) consisting of glutathione and NAD+ precursors can restore metabolic function and thus aid the recovery of COVID-19 patients. CMAs include l-serine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nicotinamide riboside, and l-carnitine tartrate, salt form of l-carnitine. Placebo-controlled, open-label phase 2 study and double-blinded phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to investigate the time of symptom-free recovery on ambulatory patients using CMAs. The results of both studies show that the time to complete recovery is significantly shorter in the CMA group (6.6\textasciitilde vs 9.3 d) in phase 2 and (5.7\textasciitilde vs 9.2 d) in phase 3 trials compared to placebo group. A comprehensive analysis of the plasma metabolome and proteome reveals major metabolic changes. Plasma levels of proteins and metabolites associated with inflammation and antioxidant metabolism are significantly improved in patients treated with CMAs as compared to placebo. The results show that treating patients infected with COVID-19 with CMAs lead to a more rapid symptom-free recovery, suggesting a role for such a therapeutic regime in the treatment of infections leading to respiratory problems.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Numerous large-scale genomic studies of matched tumor-normal samples have established the somatic landscapes of most cancer types. However, the downstream analysis of data from somatic mutations entails a number of computational and statistical approaches, requiring usage of independent software and numerous tools. Here, we describe an R Bioconductor package, Maftools, which offers a multitude of analysis and visualization modules that are commonly used in cancer genomic studies, including driver gene identification, pathway, signature, enrichment, and association analyses. Maftools only requires somatic variants in Mutation Annotation Format (MAF) and is independent of larger alignment files. With the implementation of well-established statistical and computational methods, Maftools facilitates data-driven research and comparative analysis to discover novel results from publicly available data sets. In the present study, using three of the well-annotated cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we describe the application of Maftools to reproduce known results. More importantly, we show that Maftools can also be used to uncover novel findings through integrative analysis.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Molecular fingerprints are essential cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping chemical space. Among the different types of fingerprints, substructure fingerprints perform best for small molecules such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for large molecules such as peptides. However, no available fingerprint achieves good performance on both classes of molecules.                                         Results                                Here we set out to design a new fingerprint suitable for both small and large molecules by combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest resulted in a new fingerprint called MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint up to a diameter of four bonds (MAP4). In this fingerprint the circular substructures with radii of                 r                 \textbackslash ,=\textbackslash ,1 and                 r\textbackslash ,                 =\textbackslash ,2 bonds around each atom in an atom-pair are written as two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the topological distance separating the two central atoms. These so-called atom-pair molecular shingles are hashed, and the resulting set of hashes is MinHashed to form the MAP4 fingerprint. MAP4 significantly outperforms all other fingerprints on an extended benchmark that combines the Riniker and Landrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide benchmark recovering BLAST analogs from either scrambled or point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore produces well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases as diverse as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human Metabolome Database (HMBD), and differentiates between all metabolites in HMBD, over 70\textbackslash \% of which are indistinguishable from their nearest neighbor using substructure fingerprints.                                                        Conclusion                                MAP4 is a new molecular fingerprint suitable for drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome and can be adopted as a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical space. The source code is available at                 https://github.com/reymond-group/map4                 and interactive MAP4 similarity search tools and TMAPs for various databases are accessible at                 http://map-search.gdb.tools/                 and                 http://tm.gdb.tools/map4/                 .},

  abstract = {Sepsis and septic shock are characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The liver has a central role during sepsis, and is essential to the regulation of immune defence during systemic infections by mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, acute-phase protein or cytokine production and metabolic adaptation to inflammation. However, the liver is also a target for sepsis-related injury, including hypoxic hepatitis due to ischaemia and shock, cholestasis due to altered bile metabolism, hepatocellular injury due to drug toxicity or overwhelming inflammation, as well as distinct pathologies such as secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients. Hence, hepatic dysfunction substantially impairs the prognosis of sepsis and serves as a powerful independent predictor of mortality in the intensive care unit. Sepsis is particularly problematic in patients with liver cirrhosis (who experience increased bacterial translocation from the gut and impaired microbial defence) as it can trigger acute-on-chronic liver failure - a syndrome with high short-term mortality. Here, we review the importance of the liver as a guardian, modifier and target of sepsis, the factors that contribute to sepsis in patients with liver cirrhosis and new therapeutic strategies.},

@article{MinesOpenAccJeffry2015,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In spite of its great promise, metabolomics has proven difficult to execute in an untargeted and generalizable manner. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has made it possible to gather data on thousands of cellular metabolites. However, matching metabolites to their spectral features continues to be a bottleneck, meaning that much of the collected information remains uninterpreted and that new metabolites are seldom discovered in untargeted studies. These challenges require new approaches that consider compounds beyond those available in curated biochemistry databases. DESCRIPTION: Here we present Metabolic In silico Network Expansions (MINEs), an extension of known metabolite databases to include molecules that have not been observed, but are likely to occur based on known metabolites and common biochemical reactions. We utilize an algorithm called the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE) and expert-curated reaction rules based on the Enzyme Commission classification system to propose the novel chemical structures and reactions that comprise MINE databases. Starting from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) COMPOUND database, the MINE contains over 571,000 compounds, of which 93\textbackslash \% are not present in the PubChem database. However, these MINE compounds have on average higher structural similarity to natural products than compounds from KEGG or PubChem. MINE databases were able to propose annotations for 98.6\textbackslash \% of a set of 667 MassBank spectra, 14\textbackslash \% more than KEGG alone and equivalent to PubChem while returning far fewer candidates per spectra than PubChem (46 vs. 1715 median candidates). Application of MINEs to LC-MS accurate mass data enabled the identity of an unknown peak to be confidently predicted. CONCLUSIONS: MINE databases are freely accessible for non-commercial use via user-friendly web-tools at http://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov and developer-friendly APIs. MINEs improve metabolomics peak identification as compared to general chemical databases whose results include irrelevant synthetic compounds. Furthermore, MINEs complement and expand on previous in silico generated compound databases that focus on human metabolism. We are actively developing the database; future versions of this resource will incorporate transformation rules for spontaneous chemical reactions and more advanced filtering and prioritization of candidate structures. Graphical abstractMINE database construction and access methods. The process of constructing a MINE database from the curated source databases is depicted on the left. The methods for accessing the database are shown on the right.},

  abstract = {As the major component of cell membranes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized de novo in the Kennedy pathway and then undergoes extensive deacylation-reacylation remodeling via Lands\textquotesingle  cycle. The re-acylation is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) and among the four LPCAT members in human, the LPCAT3 preferentially introduces polyunsaturated acyl onto the sn-2 position of lysophosphatidylcholine, thereby modulating the membrane fluidity and membrane protein functions therein. Combining the x-ray crystallography and the cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of LPCAT3 in apo-, acyl donor-bound, and acyl receptor-bound states. A reaction chamber was revealed in the LPCAT3 structure where the lysophosphatidylcholine and arachidonoyl-CoA were positioned in two tunnels connected near to the catalytic center. A side pocket was found expanding the tunnel for the arachidonoyl CoA and holding the main body of arachidonoyl. The structural and functional analysis provides the basis for the re-acylation of lysophosphatidylcholine and the substrate preference during the reactions.},

  abstract = {Liquid chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) has been widely used in natural product analysis. Global detection and identification of nontargeted components are desirable in natural product research, for example, in quality control of Chinese herbal medicine. Nontargeted components analysis continues to expand to exciting life science application domains such as metabonomics. With this background, the present review summarizes recent developments in the analysis of minor unknown natural products using LC-MS and mainly focuses on the determination of the molecular formulae, selection of precursor ions, and characteristic fragmentation patterns of the known compounds. This review consists of three parts. Firstly, the methods used to determine unique molecular formula of unknown compounds such as accurate mass measurements, MSn spectra, or relative isotopic abundance information, are introduced. Secondly, the methods improving signal-to-noise ratio of MS/MS spectra by manual-MS/MS or workflow targeting-only signals were elucidated; pure precursor ions can be selected by changing the precursor ion isolated window. Lastly, characteristic fragmentation patterns such as Retro-Diels-Alder (RDA), McLafferty rearrangements, "internal residue loss," and so on, occurring in the molecular ions of natural products are summarized. Classical application of characteristic fragmentation patterns in identifying unknown compounds in extracts and relevant fragmentation mechanisms are presented (RDA reactions occurring readily in the molecular ions of flavanones or isoflavanones, McLafferty-type fragmentation reactions of some natural products such as epipolythiodioxopiperazines; fragmentation by "internal residue loss" possibly involving ion-neutral complex intermediates). \textbackslash textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In addition to incorporating all user-requested compounds, our annotation efforts have emphasized immunology, natural products and metabolites in many species. All database entries are now \textquotesingle is\textbackslash \_a\textquotesingle  classified within the ontology, meaning that all of the chemicals are available to semantic reasoning tools that harness the classification hierarchy. We have completely aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO), and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds. We have incorporated additional data types including reference citations, and the species and component for metabolites. Finally, our website and web services have had several enhancements, most notably the provision of a dynamic new interactive graph-based ontology visualization.},

  abstract = {Marine microbes are known to degrade hydrocarbons; however, microbes inhabiting deep-sea sediments remain largely unexplored. Previous studies into the classical  pathways of marine microbial metabolism reveal diverse chemistries; however,  metabolic profiling of marine microbes cultured with hydrocarbons is limited. In  this study, taxonomic (amplicon sequencing) profiles of two environmental  deep-sea sediments ({\textdollar >\textdollar }1,200 m deep) were obtained, along with taxonomic and  metabolomic (mass spectrometry-based metabolomics) profiles of microbes harbored  in deep-sea sediments cultured with hydrocarbons as the sole energy source.  Samples were collected from the Gulf of M\textbackslash \textquotesingle exico (GM) and cultured for 28\textbackslash ,days  using simple (toluene, benzene, hexadecane, and naphthalene) and complex  (petroleum API 40) hydrocarbon mixtures as the sole energy sources. The sediment  samples harbored diverse microbial communities predominantly classified into  Woeseiaceae and Kiloniellaceae families, whereas Pseudomonadaceae and  Enterobacteriaceae families prevailed after sediments were cultured with  hydrocarbons. Chemical profiling of microbial metabolomes revealed diverse  chemical groups belonging primarily to the lipids and lipid-like molecules  superclass, as well as the organoheterocyclic compound superclass (ClassyFire  annotation). Metabolomic data and prediction of functional profiles indicated an  increase in aromatic and alkane degradation in samples cultured with  hydrocarbons. Previously unreported metabolites, identified as intermediates in  the degradation of hydrocarbons, were annotated as hydroxylated polyunsaturated  fatty acids and carboxylated benzene derivatives. In summary, this study used  mass spectrometry-based metabolomics coupled to chemoinformatics to demonstrate  how microbes from deep-sea sediments could be cultured in the presence of  hydrocarbons. This study also highlights how this experimental approach can be  used to increase the understanding of hydrocarbon degradation by deep-sea  sediment microbes.IMPORTANCE High-throughput technologies and emerging  informatics tools have significantly advanced knowledge of hydrocarbon metabolism  by marine microbes. However, research into microbes inhabiting deep-sea sediments  ({\textdollar >\textdollar }1,000 m) is limited compared to those found in shallow waters. In this study, a  nontargeted and nonclassical approach was used to examine the diversity of  bacterial taxa and the metabolic profiles of hydrocarbon-degrading deep-sea  microbes. In conclusion, this study used metabolomics and chemoinformatics to  demonstrate that microbes from deep-sea sediment origin thrive in the presence of  toxic and difficult-to-metabolize hydrocarbons. Notably, this study provides  evidence of previously unreported metabolites and the global chemical repertoire  associated with the metabolism of hydrocarbons by deep-sea microbes.},

ESI-MS(2) data were analyzed under nonstandardized, independent experimental conditions. MassBank is a distributed database. Each research group provides data from its own MassBank data servers distributed on the Internet. MassBank users can access either all of the MassBank data or a subset of the data by specifying one or more experimental conditions. In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized to the ESI-MS(2) data. MassBank also provides a merged spectrum for each compound prepared by merging the analyzed ESI-MS(2) data on an identical compound under different collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21-23\textbackslash \% at a similarity score of 0.6. Thus, MassBank is useful for the identification of chemical compounds and the publication of experimental data.},

  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a transcription factor present in immune cells as a long and short isoform, referred to as isoforms 1 and 3, respectively. However, investigation into potential ARNT isoform\textbackslash textendash specific immune functions is lacking despite the well-established heterodimerization requirement of ARNT with, and for the activity of, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a critical mediator of immune homeostasis. Here, using global and targeted transcriptomics analyses, we show that the relative ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio in human T cell lymphoma cells dictates the amplitude and direction of AhR target gene regulation. Specifically, shifting the ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio lower by suppressing isoform 1 enhances, or higher by suppressing isoform 3 abrogates, AhR responsiveness to ligand activation through preprograming a cellular genetic background that directs explicit gene expression patterns. Moreover, the fluctuations in gene expression patterns that accompany a decrease or increase in the ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio are associated with inflammation or immunosuppression, respectively. Molecular studies identified the unique casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site within isoform 1 as an essential parameter to the mechanism of ARNT isoform\textbackslash textendash specific regulation of AhR signaling. Notably, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ARNT isoform 1 is dependent on ligand-induced AhR nuclear translocation and is required for optimal AhR target gene regulation. These observations reveal ARNT as a central modulator of AhR activity predicated on the status of the ARNT isoform ratio and suggest that ARNT-based therapies are a viable option for tuning the immune system to target immune disorders.},

However, most phylogenetic approaches, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, cannot scale to the size of the datasets from the current pandemic. We present \textasciigrave MAximum Parsimonious Likelihood Estimation\textquotesingle  (MAPLE), an approach for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis of epidemiological genomic datasets at unprecedented scales. MAPLE infers SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies more accurately than existing maximum likelihood approaches while running up to thousands of times faster, and requiring at least 100 times less memory on large datasets. This extends the reach of genomic epidemiology, allowing the continued use of accurate phylogenetic, phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses on datasets of millions of genomes.},

  abstract = {Liver X receptors {\textdollar \textbackslash alpha\textdollar } and {\textdollar \textbackslash beta\textdollar } (LXR{\textdollar \textbackslash alpha\textdollar } and LXR{\textdollar \textbackslash beta\textdollar }) are nuclear receptors with pivotal roles in the transcriptional control of lipid metabolism. Transcriptional activity of LXRs is induced in response to elevated cellular levels of cholesterol. LXRs bind to and regulate the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in cholesterol absorption, transport, efflux, excretion and conversion to bile acids. The coordinated, tissue-specific actions of the LXR pathway maintain systemic cholesterol homeostasis and regulate immune and inflammatory responses. LXRs also regulate fatty acid metabolism by controlling the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and regulate genes that encode proteins involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation. LXRs exert important effects on the metabolism of phospholipids, which, along with cholesterol, are major constituents of cellular membranes. LXR activation preferentially drives the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids by inducing transcription of the remodelling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3. The ability of the LXR pathway to couple cellular sterol levels with the saturation of fatty acids in membrane phospholipids has implications for several physiological processes, including lipoprotein production, dietary lipid absorption and intestinal stem cell proliferation. Understanding how LXRs regulate membrane composition and function might provide new therapeutic insight into diseases associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer.},

Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient\textquotesingle s molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process. While waiting for this goal to be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programmes offers the best hope of increasing favourable outcomes.},

  abstract = {Background:               With significant clinical effects, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been attracting increasing interest of the world\textquotesingle s scientific community. However, TCM contains immense amounts of chemical components. It is a great challenge to objectively evaluate the correlation between the in vivo process and the therapeutic effect of TCM. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the recent investigation (from 2017 to 2019) on preclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of TCM via liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).                                         Method:               We reviewed the published articles regarding the PK of TCM by LC-MS/MS. In addition, we summarized information on PK parameter of bioactive components, single herb and traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions.                                         Results:               The vast majority of literature on preclinical PK of TCM uses single oral administration, the biological matrix is mostly rat plasma, and the main PK parameters include AUC, Cmax, Tmax and T1/2, etc.                                         Conclusion:               Although LC-MS/MS can be used for high-throughput analysis, the characterization of in vivo processes of TCM still has a long way. With the advantages of high sensitivity, high specificity and simple operation, the increasingly mature LC-MS/MS technology will play an important role in the PK study of TCM.},

Among these associations, protein\textendash protein interactions are particularly important due to their versatility, specificity and adaptability. The STRING database aims to integrate all known and predicted associations between proteins, including both physical interactions as well as functional associations. To achieve this, STRING collects and scores evidence from a number of sources: (i) automated text mining of the scientific literature, (ii) databases of interaction experiments and annotated complexes/pathways, (iii) computational interaction predictions from co-expression and from conserved genomic context and (iv) systematic transfers of interaction evidence from one organism to another. STRING aims for wide coverage; the upcoming version 11.5 of the resource will contain more than 14 000 organisms. In this update paper, we describe changes to the text-mining system, a new scoring-mode for physical interactions, as well as extensive user interface features for customizing, extending and sharing protein networks. In addition, we describe how to query STRING with genome-wide, experimental data, including the automated detection of enriched functionalities and potential biases in the user\textquotesingle s query data.

@article{ExpandingUrinaNeto2021,
  abstract = {The urine metabolome constitutes a rich source of functional information reflecting physiological states that are influenced by distinct conditions and  biological stresses, such as responses to drug treatments or disease  manifestations. Although global liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)  profiling provides the most comprehensive measurement of metabolites in complex  biological samples, annotation remains a challenge, and computational approaches  are necessary to translate the molecular composition into biological knowledge.  Here, we investigated the use of tandem MS-based enhanced molecular networks  (MolNetEnhancer) to improve the metabolite annotation of urine extracts. The  samples (n = 10) were analyzed by hydrophilic interaction  chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in both electrospray  ionization (ESI) modes. Consistent with other common data preprocessing software,  the use of Progenesis QI led to the annotation of up to 20 metabolites based on  MS2 library searches, showing a high fragmentation score (cosine similarity {\textdollar \textbackslash geq\textdollar }  0.7), that is, {\textdollar \textbackslash sim\textdollar }2\textbackslash \% of mass features containing MS2 spectra. Molecular networking  based on library matching resulted in the annotation of up to 62 urinary  compounds. Using a combination of unsupervised substructure discovery (MS2LDA),  the in silico tool network annotation propagation (NAP), and ClassyFire chemical  ontology, embedded in a multilayered molecular network by MolNetEnhancer, we were  able to expand the chemical characterization to {\textdollar \textbackslash sim\textdollar }50\textbackslash \% of the data set. The  integrative approach led to the annotation of 275 compounds at the metabolomics  standards initiative (MSI) confidence level 2, as well as 459 and 578 urinary  metabolites (MSI level 3) in both negative and positive ESI modes, respectively.  The exhaustive MS2-based annotation outperformed similar studies applied to  larger cohorts while offering the discovery of metabolites not identified by the  MS2 library search. This is the first work that effectively integrates orthogonal  annotation methods and MS2-based fragmentation studies to improve metabolite  annotation in urine samples.},

@article{CriticalAssessSchyma2017,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fourth round of the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification (CASMI) Contest ( www.casmi-contest.org ) was held in 2016, with two new categories for automated methods. This article covers the 208 challenges in Categories 2 and 3, without and with metadata, from organization, participation, results and post-contest evaluation of CASMI 2016 through to perspectives for future contests and small molecule annotation/identification. RESULTS: The Input Output Kernel Regression (CSI:IOKR) machine learning approach performed best in "Category 2: Best Automatic Structural Identification-In Silico Fragmentation Only", won by Team Brouard with 41\textbackslash \% challenge wins. The winner of "Category 3: Best Automatic Structural Identification-Full Information" was Team Kind (MS-FINDER), with 76\textbackslash \% challenge wins. The best methods were able to achieve over 30\textbackslash \% Top\textasciitilde 1 ranks in Category\textasciitilde 2, with all methods ranking the correct candidate in the Top\textasciitilde 10 in around 50\textbackslash \% of challenges. This success rate rose to 70\textbackslash \% Top\textasciitilde 1 ranks in Category\textasciitilde 3, with candidates in the Top\textasciitilde 10 in over 80\textbackslash \% of the challenges. The machine learning and chemistry-based approaches are shown to perform in complementary ways. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in (semi-)automated fragmentation methods for small molecule identification has been substantial. The achieved high rates of correct candidates in the Top\textasciitilde 1 and Top\textasciitilde 10, despite large candidate numbers, open up great possibilities for high-throughput annotation of untargeted analysis for "known unknowns". As more high quality training data becomes available, the improvements in machine learning methods will likely continue, but the alternative approaches still provide valuable complementary information. Improved integration of experimental context will also improve identification success further for "real life" annotations. The true "unknown unknowns" remain to be evaluated in future CASMI contests.

  abstract = {Main risk factors of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include both genetic and non-genetic factors, especially prenatal and perinatal events. Newborn screening  dried blood spot (DBS) samples have great potential for the study of early  biochemical markers of disease. To study DBS strengths and limitations in the  context of ASD research, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of newborns later  diagnosed with ASD. We performed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics on DBS  from 37 case-control pairs randomly selected from the iPSYCH sample. After  preprocessing using MZmine 2.41, metabolites were putatively annotated using  mzCloud, GNPS feature-based molecular networking, and MolNetEnhancer. A total of  4360 mass spectral features were detected, of which 150 (113 unique) could be  putatively annotated at a high confidence level. Chemical structure information  at a broad level could be retrieved for 1009 metabolites, covering 31 chemical  classes. Although no clear distinction between cases and controls was revealed,  our method covered many metabolites previously associated with ASD, suggesting  that biochemical markers of ASD are present at birth and may be monitored during  newborn screening. Additionally, we observed that gestational age, age at  sampling, and month of birth influence the metabolomic profiles of newborn DBS,  which informs us on the important confounders to address in future studies.},

@article{AN7MethylguanMeiW2022,
  abstract = {Background. Despite the constant iteration of small-molecule inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) patients with distant metastases and biochemical recurrence maintain a poor survival outcome along with an increasing morbidity in recent years. N7-Methylguanine, a new-found type of RNA modification, has demonstrated an essential role in tumor progression but has hardly been studied for its effect on prostate carcinoma. The current study aimed to seek m7G (N7-methylguanosine) related prognostic biomarkers and potential targets for PRAD treatment. Methods. 42 genes related to m7G were collected from former literatures and GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) website. Then, RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) and clinical data from TCGA-PRAD (The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate) cohort were retrieved to screen the differentially expressed m7G genes to further construct a multivariate Cox prognostic model for PRAD. Next, GSE116918, a prostate cancer cohort acquired from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database, was analyzed for the external validation group to assess the ability to predict BFFS (biochemical failure-free survival) of our m7G prognostic signature. Kaplan-Meier, ROC (receiver operator characteristic), AUC (areas under ROC curve), and calibration curves were adopted to display the performance of this prognostic signature. In addition, immune infiltration analysis was implemented to evaluate the effect of these m7G genes on immunoinfiltrating cells. Correlation with drug susceptibility of the m7G signature was also analyzed by matching drug information in CellMiner database. Results. The m7G-related prognostic signature, including three genes (EIF3D, EIF4A1, LARP1) illustrated superior prognostic ability for PRAD in both training and validation cohorts. The 5-year AUC were 0.768 for TCGA-PRAD and 0.608 for GSE116918. It can well distinguish patients into different risk groups of biochemical recurrence (                                                   p                                               \textbackslash ,=1e-04 for TCGA-PRAD and                                                   p                                               \textbackslash ,=0.0186 for GSE116918). Immune infiltration analysis suggested potential regulation of m7G genes on neutrophils and dendritic cells in PRAD. Conclusions. A m7G-related prognostic signature was constructed and validated in the current study, giving new sights of m7G methylation in predicting the prognostic and improving the treatment of PRAD.},

Here, we describe SComatic, an algorithm designed for the detection of somatic mutations in single-cell transcriptomic and ATAC-seq (assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequence) data sets directly without requiring matched bulk or single-cell DNA sequencing data. SComatic distinguishes somatic mutations from polymorphisms, RNA-editing events and artefacts using filters and statistical tests parameterized on non-neoplastic samples. Using \&gt;2.6\hspace{0.167em}million single cells from 688 single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) data sets spanning cancer and non-neoplastic samples, we show that SComatic detects mutations in single cells accurately, even in differentiated cells from polyclonal tissues that are not amenable to mutation detection using existing methods. Validated against matched genome sequencing and scRNA-seq data, SComatic achieves F1 scores between 0.6 and 0.7 across diverse data sets, in comparison to 0.2\textendash 0.4 for the second-best performing method. In summary, SComatic permits de novo mutational signature analysis, and the study of clonal heterogeneity and mutational burdens at single-cell resolution.</jats:p>},

One consequence of such sequencing data explosion is the increasing cost and complexity of data processing. The preprocessing of FASTQ data, which means removing adapter contamination, filtering low‐quality reads, and correcting wrongly represented bases, is an indispensable but resource intensive part of sequencing data analysis. Therefore, although a lot of software applications have been developed to solve this problem, bioinformatics scientists and engineers are still pursuing faster, simpler, and more energy‐efficient software. Several years ago, the author developed fastp, which is an ultrafast all‐in‐one FASTQ data preprocessor with many modern features. This software has been approved by many bioinformatics users and has been continuously maintained and updated. Since the first publication on fastp, it has been greatly improved, making it even faster and more powerful. For instance, the duplication evaluation module has been improved, and a new deduplication module has been added. This study aimed to introduce the new features of fastp and demonstrate how it was designed and implemented.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods and in particular random forests are promising approaches for prediction based on high dimensional omics data sets. They provide variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power. If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways, approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination (RFE). {\textdollar \textbackslash quad\textdollar }In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.},

However, their identification has long been a challenge even with the state-of-the-art analysis technologies like high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) due to their complexity. Emerging               in silico               chemical structure prediction tools have provided time-saving and highly efficient approaches for identification of these complex samples. Nevertheless, the interpretation of these MS annotations into key supporting evidence towards specific questions is still a bottleneck in medicinal and biological fields. Here we present a deep clustering-based MS data visualization strategy (MCnebula), integrated with the influential open-source automatic MS annotation platform SIRIUS and               in vivo               and               in vitro               methods, to screen and validate potential lead compounds from natural products. MCnebula could provide multi-layer clustering profiles with chemical ontologies and comparative analysis of differential treatments. Plantaginis Semen (PS) is commonly used for treating kidney disease and usually stir-fried with salt water to enhance its anti-renal fibrosis effect, but the reason behind this remains unclear. Taking PS as an example, we comprehensively identified and compared the raw and processed PS extracts with SIRIUS-MCnebula, and screened potential anti-renal fibrotic lead compounds using weighted fold change analysis. Eighty-nine components were identified in PS with isoacteoside, calceolarioside B, 2{\textdollar {\textquotesingle }\textdollar }-acetylacteoside, and plantainoside D being screened and validated to treat renal fibrosis. The novel developed mass spectral data visualization strategy combined with biological function investigation and validation workflow could not only accelerate the discovery of lead compounds from medicinal natural products, but also shed new light on the traditional processing theory.},

@article{BiotransformerDjoumb2019,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of computational tools for metabolism prediction have been developed over the last 20\textasciitilde years to predict the structures of small molecules undergoing biological transformation or environmental degradation. These tools were largely developed to facilitate absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies, although there is now a growing interest in using such tools to facilitate metabolomics and exposomics studies. However, their use and widespread adoption is still hampered by several factors, including their limited scope, breath of coverage, availability, and performance. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we have developed BioTransformer, a freely available software package for accurate, rapid, and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction and compound identification. BioTransformer combines a machine learning approach with a knowledge-based approach to predict small molecule metabolism in human tissues (e.g. liver tissue), the human gut as well as the environment (soil and water microbiota), via its metabolism prediction tool. A comprehensive evaluation of BioTransformer showed that it was able to outperform two state-of-the-art commercially available tools (Meteor Nexus and ADMET Predictor), with precision and recall values up to 7 times better than those obtained for Meteor Nexus or ADMET Predictor on the same sets of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, phytochemicals or endobiotics under similar or identical constraints. Furthermore BioTransformer was able to reproduce 100\textbackslash \% of the transformations and metabolites predicted by the EAWAG pathway prediction system. Using mass spectrometry data obtained from a rat experimental study with epicatechin supplementation, BioTransformer was also able to correctly identify 39 previously reported epicatechin metabolites via its metabolism identification tool, and suggest 28 potential metabolites, 17 of which matched nine monoisotopic masses for which no evidence of a previous report could be found. CONCLUSION: BioTransformer can be used as an open access command-line tool, or a software library. It is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/djoumbou/biotransformerjar/ . Moreover, it is also freely available as an open access RESTful application at www.biotransformer.ca , which allows users to manually or programmatically submit queries, and retrieve metabolism predictions or compound identification data.},

The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the therapeutic mechanisms of selected active compounds in Cornus officinalis (loganin, ursolic acid, and morroniside) and Paeonia lactiflora (paeoniflorin and albiflorin) via network pharmacology. The pharmacological properties of the five active compounds were evaluated and their potential target genes were identified by database screening. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional analysis were performed to determine the enriched molecular pathways associated with the active compounds. Using network pharmacology tools, eight genes (IL1{\textdollar \textbackslash beta\textdollar }, VEGFA, STAT3, TP53, IL6, TNF, FOS, and LGALS3) were identified as common targets between RA and the five active compounds. Molecular docking simulation revealed the compound-target relationship between the five active compounds and three selected targets from the eight common ones (LGALS3, STAT3, and VEGFA). The compound-target relationships were subsequently validated via preliminary               in vivo               experiments in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis. Rats subjected to collagen-induced arthritis showed increased protein expression of LGALS3, STAT3, and VEGFA in synovial tissues. However, treatment using Cornus officinalis or/and Paeonia lactiflora, as well as their most drug-like active compounds (ursolic acid or/and paeoniflorin, respectively, identified based on pharmacological properties), attenuated the expression of these three targets, as previously predicted. Collectively, network pharmacology allowed the pharmacological and molecular roles of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia lactiflora to be systematically revealed, further establishing them as important candidate drugs in the treatment and management of RA.},

  abstract = {Significance             Molecular patient stratification and disease subtyping are ongoing and high-impact problems that rely on the identification of characteristic molecular signatures. Current computational methods show high sensitivity to custom parameterization, which leads to inconsistent performance on different molecular data. Our new method, MoSBi (molecular signature identification using biclustering), 1) enables so far unmatched high performance for stratification and subtyping across datasets of various different biomolecules, 2) provides a scalable solution for visualizing the results and their correspondence to clinical factors, and 3) has immediate practical relevance through its automatic workflow where individual selection, parameterization, screening, and visualization of biclustering algorithms is not required. MoSBi is a major step forward with a high impact for clinical and wet-lab researchers.           ,              The improving access to increasing amounts of biomedical data provides completely new chances for advanced patient stratification and disease subtyping strategies. This requires computational tools that produce uniformly robust results across highly heterogeneous molecular data. Unsupervised machine learning methodologies are able to discover de novo patterns in such data. Biclustering is especially suited by simultaneously identifying sample groups and corresponding feature sets across heterogeneous omics data. The performance of available biclustering algorithms heavily depends on individual parameterization and varies with their application. Here, we developed MoSBi (molecular signature identification using biclustering), an automated multialgorithm ensemble approach that integrates results utilizing an error model-supported similarity network. We systematically evaluated the performance of 11 available and established biclustering algorithms together with MoSBi. For this, we used transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data, as well as synthetic datasets covering various data properties. Profiting from multialgorithm integration, MoSBi identified robust group and disease-specific signatures across all scenarios, overcoming single algorithm specificities. Furthermore, we developed a scalable network-based visualization of bicluster communities that supports biological hypothesis generation. MoSBi is available as an R package and web service to make automated biclustering analysis accessible for application in molecular sample stratification.},

@article{SepticShockNoPuskar2018,
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-induced metabolic disturbances include hyperlactatemia, disruption of glycolysis, protein catabolism, and altered fatty acid metabolism. It may also lower serum L-carnitine that supports the use of L-carnitine supplementation as a treatment to ameliorate several of these metabolic consequences. METHODS: To further understand the association between L-carnitine-induced changes in serum acylcarnitines, fatty acid metabolism and survival, serum samples from (T0), 12{\textdollar \textbackslash mkern1mu\textdollar }hfollowing completion (T24) of L-carnitine (n{\textdollar \textbackslash mkern1mu\textdollar }={\textdollar \textbackslash mkern1mu\textdollar }16) or placebo (n{\textdollar \textbackslash mkern1mu\textdollar }={\textdollar \textbackslash mkern1mu\textdollar }15) administration, and 48{\textdollar \textbackslash mkern1mu\textdollar }h (T48) after enrollment from patients with septic shock enrolled in a randomized control trial were assayed for acylcarnitines, free fatty acids, and insulin. Data were analyzed comparing 1-year survivors and nonsurvivors within treatment groups. RESULTS: Mortality was 8 of 16 (50\textbackslash \%) and 12 of 15 (80\textbackslash \%) at 1 year for L-carnitine and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Free carnitine, C2, C3, and C8 acylcarnitines were higher among nonsurvivors at enrollment. L-Carnitine treatment increased levels of all measured acylcarnitines; an effect that was sustained for at least 36{\textdollar \textbackslash mkern1mu\textdollar }h following completion of the infusion and was more prominent among nonsurvivors. Several fatty acids followed a similar, though less consistent pattern. Glucose, lactate, and insulin levels did not differ based on survival or treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: In human patients with septic shock, L-Carnitine supplementation increases a broad range of acylcarnitine concentrations that persist after cessation of infusion, demonstrating both immediate and sustained effects on the serum metabolome. Nonsurvivors demonstrate a distinct metabolic response to L-carnitine compared with survivors, which may indicate preexisting or more profound metabolic derangement that constrains any beneficial response to treatment.},

  abstract = {Renewed interest in metabolic research over the last two decades has inspired an explosion of technological developments for studying metabolism. At the forefront of methodological innovation is an approach referred to as "untargeted" or "discovery" metabolomics. The experimental objective of this technique is to comprehensively measure the entire metabolome, which constitutes a largely undefined set of molecules. Given its potential comprehensive coverage, untargeted metabolomics is often the first choice of experiments for investigators pursuing a metabolic research question. It is important to recognize, however, that untargeted metabolomics may not always be the optimal experimental approach. Conventionally, untargeted metabolomics only provides information about relative differences in metabolite pool sizes. Therefore, depending on the specific scientific question at hand, a complementary approach involving stable isotopes (such as metabolic flux analysis) may be better suited to provide biological insights. Unlike untargeted metabolomics, stable-isotope methods can provide information about differences in reaction rates.},

Eucommia ulmoides               is one of the traditional Chinese medicine herbs, which has been used to recover functions of the kidney. However, its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the effects and protective mechanism of               Eucommia ulmoides               extract on renal injury caused by long-term high purine diets in rats. SD rats underwent an intragastric adenine (200 mg kg               -1               d               -1               ) administration for 9 weeks and were treated for 15 weeks. The results demonstrated that               Eucommia ulmoides               extract significantly reduced serum Cre and BUN levels in rats. H\textbackslash \&E and Masson\textquotesingle s trichrome stains showed notable lowering of the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the formation of fibrous tissues and collagen fibers, and improvement in the pathological morphology of kidneys. It also suppressed the protein and mRNA expressions of TGF-{\textdollar \textbackslash beta\textdollar }1 and {\textdollar \textbackslash alpha\textdollar }-SMA and enhanced E-cadherin expression. Meanwhile,               Eucommia ulmoides               extract prominently inhibited the mRNA expression of Col I, Col III, Col IV, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 and promoted expressions of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Through our study, it is the first time to prove that               Eucommia ulmoides               extract could ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis and may involve in the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation enzyme (MMPs/TIMPs) system, promotion of the expression of E-cadherin, and suppression of expressions of TGF-{\textdollar \textbackslash beta\textdollar }1 and {\textdollar \textbackslash alpha\textdollar }-SMA. The results provide a significant implication for the utilization of               Eunomia Ulmoides               extract as functional foods to enhance renal functions and improve renal injury caused by high purine diets.},

  abstract = {Large-scale metabolite annotation is a challenge in liquid chromatogram-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics. Here, we develop a metabolic reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm (MetDNA) that expands metabolite annotations without the need for a comprehensive standard spectral library. MetDNA is based on the rationale that seed metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbors tend to share structural similarities resulting in similar MS2 spectra. MetDNA characterizes initial seed metabolites using a small library of MS2 spectra, and utilizes their experimental MS2 spectra as surrogate spectra to annotate their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites, which subsequently serve as the basis for recursive analysis. Using different LC-MS platforms, data acquisition methods, and biological samples, we showcase the utility and versatility of MetDNA and demonstrate that about 2000 metabolites can cumulatively be annotated from one experiment. Our results demonstrate that MetDNA substantially expands metabolite annotation, enabling quantitative assessment of metabolic pathways and facilitating integrative multi-omics analysis.},

@article{TransfollicularRaufas2006,
  abstract = {There are a large number of studies on the pharmacological activity of lineolic acid (LA) on the skin; however, very little work has been carried out to determine how LA targets the follicular structure. The aim of this study was to identify the preferred route of penetration of LA and to localize the molecule, using a microautoradiographic technique associated with a compartmental approach. In an in vitro test using topical application of 0.05 g of a formulation containing 1\textbackslash \% of LA, 10\textbackslash \% of the total recovery was found in the stratum corneum and dermis after 6 h. Microautoradiographic analysis of a \textquotesingle virtual\textquotesingle  slide showed most of the silver grains, i.e. LA, at the hair sheath, and none in the dermal compartment, confirming the diffusion of LA through a preferred transfollicular route. These results show, for the first time on human scalp skin, that the combination of compartmental analysis and microautoradiography points to a preferred transfollicular route of diffusion of topically applied LA. Thanks to its high-resolution, microautoradiography offers the advantage of providing detailed in situ information on the delivery of LA in the skin, including the cellular location of the molecule.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics are a fundamental resource for a variety of research applications <jats:sup>1\textendash 6</jats:sup>. Yet despite their widespread utility, no common storage format has been widely adopted, hindering tool development and data sharing, analysis and integration. Existing tabular formats <jats:sup>7,8</jats:sup> often ambiguously or incompletely store information about genetic variants and their associations, and also lack essential metadata increasing the possibility of errors in data interpretation and post-GWAS analyses. Additionally, data in these formats are typically not indexed, requiring the whole file to be read which is computationally inefficient. To address these issues, we propose an adaptation of the variant call format<jats:sup>9</jats:sup> (GWAS-VCF) and have produced a suite of open-source tools for using this format in downstream analyses. Simulation studies determine GWAS-VCF is 9-46x faster than tabular alternatives when extracting variant(s) by genomic position. Our results demonstrate the GWAS-VCF provides a robust and performant solution for sharing, analysis and integration of GWAS data. We provide open access to over 10,000 complete GWAS summary datasets converted to this format (available from: <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk">https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk</jats:ext-link>).</jats:p>},

@article{MetabolomicsAnRamabu2021,
  abstract = {Momordica plant species (Cucurbitaceae), have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and for nutritional purposes. Plants from this family are  thus claimed to be phytochemically rich, representing an inexhaustible source of  natural products. However, the chemical space of these Momordica species has not  yet been fully decoded, and due to the inherent complexity of plant metabolomes,  the characterization of the Momordica phytochemistry remains challenging. Thus,  in this study we propose the use of molecular networking to unravel the molecular  families within the metabolomes of four Momordica species (M. cardiospermoides,  M. balsamina, M. charantia and M. foetida) and highlight the relevance of  molecular networking in exploring the chemotaxonomy of these plants. In silico  annotation tools (Network Annotation Propagation and DEREPLICATOR) and an  unsupervised substructure identification tool (MS2LDA) were also explored to  complement the classical molecular networking output and integration using  MolNetEnhancer within GNPS. This allowed for the visualisation of chemical  classes and the variety of substructures within the molecular families. The use  of computational tools in this study highlighted various classes of metabolites,  such as a wide range of flavonoids, terpenoids and lipids. Herein, these species  are revealed to be phytochemically rich plants consisting of many biologically  active metabolites differentially distributed within the different species, with  the metabolome of M. cardiospermoides dereplicated in this paper for the first  time.},

  abstract = {The Blue Biotechnology and Ecotoxicology Culture Collection (LEGE-CC) holds a vast number of cyanobacteria whose chemical richness is still largely unknown. To  expedite its bioactivity screening we developed a natural products library. Sixty  strains and four environmental samples were chromatographed, using a  semiautomatic HPLC system, yielding 512 fractions that were tested for their  cytotoxic activity against 2D and 3D models of human colon carcinoma (HCT 116),  and non-cancerous cell line hCMEC/D3. Six fractions showed high cytotoxicity  against 2D and 3D cell models (group A), and six other fractions were selected by  their effects on 3D cells (group B). The metabolome of each group was organized  and characterized using the MolNetEnhancer workflow, and its processing with  MetaboAnalyst allowed discrimination of the mass features with the highest fold  change, and thus the ones that might be bioactive. Of those, mass features  without precedented identification were mostly found in group A, indicating seven  possible novel bioactive molecules, alongside in silico putative annotation of  five cytotoxic compounds. Manual dereplication of group B tentatively identified  nine pheophytin and pheophorbide derivatives. Our approach enabled the selection  of 7 out of 60 cyanobacterial strains for anticancer drug discovery, providing  new data concerning the chemical composition of these cyanobacteria.},

Many of the tested plants in this study have been traditionally used in the treatment of Diabetes mellitus type 2 and associated symptoms in different cultural areas. Additionally, hypoglycemic effects, such as a decrease in blood glucose concentration, have been demonstrated               in vivo               for these plants. In order to determine the mode of action, the plants were prepared as methanolic and aqueous extracts and tested for their effects on intestinal glucose and fructose absorption in Caco2 cells. The results of this screening showed significant and reproducible inhibition of glucose uptake between 40 and 80\textbackslash \% by methanolic extracts made from the fruits of               Aronia melanocarpa               ,               Cornus officinalis               ,               Crataegus pinnatifida               ,               Lycium chinense               , and               Vaccinium myrtillus               ; the leaves of               Brassica oleracea               ,               Juglans regia               , and               Peumus boldus               ; and the roots of               Adenophora triphylla               . Furthermore, glucose uptake was inhibited between 50 and 70\textbackslash \% by aqueous extracts made from the bark of               Eucommia ulmoides               and the fruit skin of               Malus domestica               .

@article{EmpiricalBayesPhipso,
  abstract = {Empirical Bayes is a statistical approach for estimating a series of unknown parameters from a series of associated data observations. It provides an effective means to \textasciigrave \textasciigrave borrow strength\textquotesingle \textquotesingle  from the ensemble of cases when making inference about each individual case. Such methods are ideally suited to genomic applications where data is collected for tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. Empirical Bayes methods can however be less effective when highly exceptional cases are present. This article proposes a practical solution whereby exceptional cases are identified and the amount of \textasciigrave \textasciigrave learning\textquotesingle \textquotesingle  from the ensemble appropriate for each case is assessed on a case-specific basis. The approach is developed in detail for the problem of estimating genewise variances from microarray data. In this context, the proposed robust empirical Bayes procedure recognizes and protects against hyper-variable genes. The new procedure improves statistical power for most genes in many microarray data sets. Simulations show that the robust estimation procedure correctly controls the type I error rate and does not increase the number of false discoveries when no hyper-variable genes are present. In the presence of hyper-variable genes, the robust method improves power to detect differential expression for the majority of genes that are not outliers. The proposed robust method is applied to an example microarray data set, on which it correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with a hidden covariate and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package which is freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

Here, we develop an ion mobility-mass spectrometry based four-dimensional sterolomics technology leveraged by a machine learning-empowered high-coverage library ({\textdollar >\textdollar }2000 sterol lipids) for accurate identification. We apply this four-dimensional technology to profile the spatially resolved landscapes of sterol lipids in ten functional regions of the mouse brain, and quantitatively uncover \textbackslash textasciitilde 200 sterol lipids uniquely distributed in specific regions with concentrations spanning up to 8 orders of magnitude. Further spatial analysis pinpoints age-associated differences in region-specific sterol lipid metabolism, revealing changes in the numbers of altered sterol lipids, concentration variations, and age-dependent coregulation networks. These findings will contribute to our understanding of abnormal sterol lipid metabolism and its role in brain diseases.},

@article{ChallengesAndCuiL2018,
  abstract = {In the past decade, advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have revolutionized untargeted metabolomics analyses. By mining metabolomes more deeply, researchers are now primed to uncover key metabolites and their associations with diseases. The employment of untargeted metabolomics has led to new biomarker discoveries and a better mechanistic understanding of diseases with applications in precision medicine. However, many major pertinent challenges remain. First, compound identification has been poor, and left an overwhelming number of unidentified peaks. Second, partial, incomplete metabolomes persist due to factors such as limitations in mass spectrometry data acquisition speeds, wide-range of metabolites concentrations, and cellular/tissue/temporal-specific expression changes that confound our understanding of metabolite perturbations. Third, to contextualize metabolites in pathways and biology is difficult because many metabolites partake in multiple pathways, have yet to be described species specificity, or possess unannotated or more-complex functions that are not easily characterized through metabolomics analyses. From a translational perspective, information related to novel metabolite biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and drug targets might be sparser than they should be. Thankfully, significant progress has been made and novel solutions are emerging, achieved through sustained academic and industrial community efforts in terms of hardware, computational, and experimental approaches. Given the rapidly growing utility of metabolomics, this review will offer new perspectives, increase awareness of the major challenges in LC-MS metabolomics that will significantly benefit the metabolomics community and also the broader the biomedical community metabolomics aspire to serve.},

In this work, three natural antioxidants were selected for exploring the oxidation resistance of the oil compared with the common synthetic antioxidant BHT.

The predicted comprehensive performance is as follows: myricetin\textasciitilde {\textdollar >\textasciitilde \textdollar }epicatechin\textasciitilde {\textdollar >\textasciitilde \textdollar }caffeic acid\textasciitilde {\textdollar >\textasciitilde \textdollar }BHT. Free radical scavenging assay and Rancimat assay confirmed the antioxidant activity and protective effect on oil.

  abstract = {COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are increased via unknown mechanisms in patients with diabetes and kidney disease. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into host cells. Because ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of kidney biopsies from healthy living donors and patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell-specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes. Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19-related kidney damage.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Molecular networking connects mass spectra of molecules based on the similarity of their fragmentation patterns. However, during ionization, molecules commonly form multiple ion species with different fragmentation behavior. As a result, the fragmentation spectra of these ion species often remain unconnected in tandem mass spectrometry-based molecular networks, leading to redundant and disconnected sub-networks of the same compound classes. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop Ion Identity Molecular Networking (IIMN) that integrates chromatographic peak shape correlation analysis into molecular networks to connect and collapse different ion species of the same molecule. The new feature relationships improve network connectivity for structurally related molecules, can be used to reveal unknown ion-ligand complexes, enhance annotation within molecular networks, and facilitate the expansion of spectral reference libraries. IIMN is integrated into various open source feature finding tools and the GNPS environment. Moreover, IIMN-based spectral libraries with a broad coverage of ion species are publicly available.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Phosphoproteomics integrating data-independent acquisition (DIA) enables deep phosphoproteome profiling with improved quantification reproducibility and accuracy compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based phosphoproteomics. DIA data mining heavily relies on a spectral library that in most cases is built on DDA analysis of the same sample. Construction of this project-specific DDA library impairs the analytical throughput, limits the proteome coverage, and increases the sample size for DIA phosphoproteomics. Herein we introduce a deep neural network, DeepPhospho, which conceptually differs from previous deep learning models to achieve accurate predictions of LC-MS/MS data for phosphopeptides. By leveraging in silico libraries generated by DeepPhospho, we establish a DIA workflow for phosphoproteome profiling which involves DIA data acquisition and data mining with DeepPhospho predicted libraries, thus circumventing the need of DDA library construction. Our DeepPhospho-empowered workflow substantially expands the phosphoproteome coverage while maintaining high quantification performance, which leads to the discovery of more signaling pathways and regulated kinases in an EGF signaling study than the DDA library-based approach. DeepPhospho is provided as a web server as well as an offline app to facilitate user access to model training, predictions and library generation.},

In fact, the galloping rate of data acquisition and sharing of mass spectrometry data has led to the current availability of many tens of terabytes of public data in thousands of human data sets. The systematic reanalysis of these public data sets has been used to build a community-scale spectral library of 2.1 million precursors for over 1 million unique sequences from over 19,000 proteins (including spectra of synthetic peptides). However, it has remained challenging to find and inspect spectra of peptides covering functional protein regions or matching novel proteins. ProteinExplorer addresses these challenges with an intuitive interface mapping tens of millions of identifications to functional sites on nearly all human proteins while maintaining provenance for every identification back to the original data set and data file. Additionally, ProteinExplorer facilitates the selection and inspection of HPP-compliant peptides whose spectra can be matched to spectra of synthetic peptides and already includes HPP-compliant evidence for 107 missing (PE2, PE3, and PE4) and 23 dubious (PE5) proteins. Finally, ProteinExplorer allows users to rate spectra and to contribute to a community library of peptides entitled PrEdict (Protein Existance dictionary) mapping to novel proteins but whose preliminary identities have not yet been fully established with community-scale false discovery rates and synthetic peptide spectra.

  abstract = {Metabolite identification for untargeted metabolomics is often hampered by the lack of experimentally collected reference spectra from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). To circumvent this problem, Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID) was developed to accurately predict electrospray ionization-MS/MS (ESI-MS/MS) spectra from chemical structures and to aid in compound identification via MS/MS spectral matching. While earlier versions of CFM-ID performed very well, CFM-ID\textquotesingle s performance for predicting the MS/MS spectra of certain classes of compounds, including many lipids, was quite poor. Furthermore, CFM-ID\textquotesingle s compound identification capabilities were limited because it did not use experimentally available MS/MS spectra nor did it exploit metadata in its spectral matching algorithm. Here, we describe significant improvements to CFM-ID\textquotesingle s performance and speed. These include (1) the implementation of a rule-based fragmentation approach for lipid MS/MS spectral prediction, which greatly improves the speed and accuracy of CFM-ID; (2) the inclusion of experimental MS/MS spectra and other metadata to enhance CFM-ID\textquotesingle s compound identification abilities; (3) the development of new scoring functions that improves CFM-ID\textquotesingle s accuracy by 21.1\textbackslash \%; and (4) the implementation of a chemical classification algorithm that correctly classifies unknown chemicals (based on their MS/MS spectra) in {\textdollar >\textdollar }80\textbackslash \% of the cases.

Metabolomics detects vastly more metabolic  signals that may be used to precisely define the health status of individuals.  However, many compounds remain unidentified, hampering biochemical conclusions.  Here, we annotate all metabolites detected by two untargeted metabolomic assays,  hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry  and charged surface hybrid (CSH)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry. Over 9,000  unique metabolite signals were detected, of which 42\textbackslash \% triggered MS/MS  fragmentations in data-dependent mode. On the highest Metabolomics Standards  Initiative (MSI) confidence level 1, we identified 175 compounds using authentic  standards with precursor mass, retention time, and MS/MS matching. An additional  578 compounds were annotated by precursor accurate mass and MS/MS matching alone,  MSI level 2, including a novel library specifically geared at acylcarnitines  (CarniBlast). The rest of the metabolome is usually left unannotated. To fill  this gap, we used the in silico fragmentation tool CSI:FingerID and the new NIST  hybrid search to annotate all further compounds (MSI level 3). Testing the  top-ranked metabolites in CSI:Finger ID annotations yielded 40\textbackslash \% accuracy when  applied to the MSI level 1 identified compounds. We classified all MSI level 3  annotations by the NIST hybrid search using the ClassyFire ontology into 21  superclasses that were further distinguished into 184 chemical classes.

  abstract = {The metabolome of an organism depends on environmental factors and intracellular regulation and provides information about the physiological conditions. Metabolomics helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated, since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex. Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions. We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification, and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data. Machine learning methods applied to MS-based metabolomics ease data analysis and can support clinical decisions, guide metabolic engineering, and stimulate fundamental biological discoveries.},

This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Metabolomics has shown great potential to improve the understanding of complex diseases, potentially leading to therapeutic target identification. However, no single analytical method allows monitoring all metabolites in a sample, resulting in incomplete metabolic fingerprints. This incompleteness constitutes a stumbling block to interpretation, raising the need for methods that can enrich those fingerprints. We propose MetaboRank, a new solution inspired by social network recommendation systems for the identification of metabolites potentially related to a metabolic fingerprint. Results: MetaboRank method had been used to enrich metabolomics data obtained on cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients suffering from hepatic encephalopathy (HE). MetaboRank successfully recommended metabolites not present in the original fingerprint. The quality of recommendations was evaluated by using literature automatic search, in order to check that recommended metabolites could be related to the disease. Complementary mass spectrometry experiments and raw data analysis were performed to confirm these suggestions. In particular, MetaboRank recommended the overlooked {\textdollar \textbackslash alpha\textdollar }-ketoglutaramate as a metabolite which should be added to the metabolic fingerprint of HE, thus suggesting that metabolic fingerprints enhancement can provide new insight on complex diseases. Availability and implementation: Method is implemented in the MetExplore server and is available at www.metexplore.fr. A tutorial is available at https://metexplore.toulouse.inra.fr/com/tutorials/MetaboRank/2017-MetaboRank.pdf. Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Polysaccharides cannot be simply sequenced because they are often highly branched and lack a uniform structure. Furthermore, large polymeric structures cannot be directly analyzed by mass spectrometry techniques, a problem that has been solved for polynucleotides and proteins. While restriction enzymes have advanced genomic analysis, and trypsin has advanced proteomic analysis, there has been no equivalent enzyme for universal polysaccharide digestion. We describe the development and application of a chemical method for producing oligosaccharides from polysaccharides. The released oligosaccharides are characterized by advanced liquid chromatography\textbackslash textendash mass spectrometry (LC\textbackslash textendash MS) methods with high sensitivity, accuracy and throughput. The technique is first used to identify polysaccharides by oligosaccharide fingerprinting. Next, the polysaccharide compositions of food and feces are determined, further illustrating the utility of technique in food and clinical studies.},

  abstract = {We explored potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms regarding multiple benefits after bariatric surgery. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) after bariatric surgery were identified by analyzing two expression profiles from the GEO. Subsequently, enrichment analysis, GSEA, PPI network, and gene-microRNAs and gene-TFs networks were interrogated to identify hub genes and associated pathways. Co-expressed DEGs included one that was up-regulated and 22 that were down-regulated genes. The enrichment analyses indicated that down-regulated DEGs were significantly involved in inflammatory responses. GSEA provided comprehensive evidence that most genes enriched in pro-inflammation pathways, while gene-sets after surgery enriched in metabolism. We identified nine hub genes in the PPI network, most of which were validated as highly expressed and hypomethylated in obesity by Attie Lab Diabetes and DiseaseMeth databases, respectively. DGIdb was also applied to predict potential therapeutic agents that might reverse abnormally high hub gene expression. Bariatric surgery induces a significant shift from an obese pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory state, with improvement in adipocyte metabolic function - representing key mechanisms whereby AT function improves after bariatric surgery. Our study deepens a mechanistic understanding of the benefits of bariatric surgery and provides potential biomarkers or treatment targets for further research.},

However, discriminating active enhancers from other               cis               -regulatory elements, predicting enhancer strength and identifying their target genes is challenging. Here we establish histone H2B N-terminus multisite lysine acetylation (H2BNTac) as a signature of active enhancers. H2BNTac prominently marks candidate active enhancers and a subset of promoters and discriminates them from ubiquitously active promoters. Two mechanisms underlie the distinct H2BNTac specificity: (1) unlike H3K27ac, H2BNTac is specifically catalyzed by CBP/p300; (2) H2A\textbackslash textendash H2B, but not H3\textbackslash textendash H4, are rapidly exchanged through transcription-induced nucleosome remodeling. H2BNTac-positive candidate enhancers show a high validation rate in orthogonal enhancer activity assays and a vast majority of endogenously active enhancers are marked by H2BNTac and H3K27ac. Notably, H2BNTac intensity predicts enhancer strength and outperforms current state-of-the-art models in predicting CBP/p300 target genes. These findings have broad implications for generating fine-grained enhancer maps and modeling CBP/p300-dependent gene regulation.},

Complicated and error-prone data analysis still remains a bottleneck, however, especially for identifying novel metabolites.

This review sheds light on individual strengths and weaknesses of these tools, and attempts to evaluate them\textbackslash textemdash especially in view of lipidomics, when considering complex mixtures found in biological samples as well as mass spectrometer inter-instrument variability.},

@article{ImprovingPeakYuTi2014,
  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Peak detection is a key step in the preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data generated from high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The common practice is to use filters with predetermined parameters to select peaks in the LC/MS profile. This rigid approach can cause suboptimal performance when the choice of peak model and parameters do not suit the data characteristics.             Results: Here we present a method that learns directly from various data features of the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) to differentiate between true peak regions from noise regions in the LC/MS profile. It utilizes the knowledge of known metabolites, as well as robust machine learning approaches. Unlike currently available methods, this new approach does not assume a parametric peak shape model and allows maximum flexibility. We demonstrate the superiority of the new approach using real data. Because matching to known metabolites entails uncertainties and cannot be considered a gold standard, we also developed a probabilistic receiver-operating characteristic (pROC) approach that can incorporate uncertainties.             Availability and implementation: The new peak detection approach is implemented as part of the apLCMS package available at http://web1.sph.emory.edu/apLCMS/             Contact: \textasciitilde tyu8@emory.edu             Supplementary information: \textasciitilde Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{AnUpdatedReviKnuple2020,
  abstract = {Lysophosphatidylcholines are a group of bioactive lipids heavily investigated in the context of inflammation and atherosclerosis development. While present in plasma during physiological conditions, their concentration can drastically increase in certain inflammatory states. Lysophosphatidylcholines are widely regarded as potent pro-inflammatory and deleterious mediators, but an increasing number of more recent studies show multiple beneficial properties under various pathological conditions. Many of the discrepancies in the published studies are due to the investigation of different species or mixtures of lysophatidylcholines and the use of supra-physiological concentrations in the absence of serum or other carrier proteins. Furthermore, interpretation of the results is complicated by the rapid metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in cells and tissues to pro-inflammatory lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly, most of the recent studies, in contrast to older studies, found lower LPC plasma levels associated with unfavorable disease outcomes. Being the most abundant lysophospholipid in plasma, it is of utmost importance to understand its physiological functions and shed light on the discordant literature connected to its research. LPCs should be recognized as important homeostatic mediators involved in all stages of vascular inflammation. In this review, we want to point out potential pro- and anti-inflammatory activities of lysophospholipids in the vascular system and highlight recent discoveries about the effect of lysophosphatidylcholines on immune cells at the endothelial vascular interface. We will also look at their potential clinical application as biomarkers.},

Reference libraries are generated from chemical standards and are therefore limited in size relative to known chemical space. To address this limitation, in silico spectra (i.e., MS/MS or MS2 spectra), predicted via Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID) algorithms, were generated for compounds within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\textquotesingle s (EPA) Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database (totaling, at the time of analysis, \textbackslash textasciitilde\textbackslash ,765,000 substances). Experimental spectra from EPA\textquotesingle s Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT) mixtures (               n               \textbackslash ,=\textbackslash ,10) were then used to evaluate the performance of the in silico spectra. Overall, MS2 spectra were acquired for 377 unique compounds from the ENTACT mixtures. Approximately 53\textbackslash \% of these compounds were correctly identified using a commercial reference library, whereas up to 50\textbackslash \% were correctly identified as the top hit using the in silico library. Together, the reference and in silico libraries were able to correctly identify 73\textbackslash \% of the 377 ENTACT substances. When using the in silico spectra for candidate filtering, an examination of binary classifiers showed a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.90 associated with false positive rates (FPRs) of 0.10 to 0.85, depending on the sample and method of candidate filtering. Taken together, these findings show the abilities of in silico spectra to correctly identify true positives in complex samples (at rates comparable to those observed with reference spectra), and efficiently filter large numbers of potential false positives from further consideration.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Advances in genome sequencing have produced hundreds of thousands of bacterial genome sequences, many of which have integrated prophages derived from temperate bacteriophages. These prophages play key roles by influencing bacterial metabolism, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, and defense against viral attack. However, they vary considerably even among related bacterial strains, and they are challenging to identify computationally and to extract precisely for comparative genomic analyses. Here, we describe DEPhT, a multimodal tool for prophage discovery and extraction. It has three run modes that facilitate rapid screening of large numbers of bacterial genomes, precise extraction of prophage sequences, and prophage annotation. DEPhT uses genomic architectural features that discriminate between phage and bacterial sequences for efficient prophage discovery, and targeted homology searches for precise prophage extraction. DEPhT is designed for prophage discovery in Mycobacterium genomes but can be adapted broadly to other bacteria. We deploy DEPhT to demonstrate that prophages are prevalent in Mycobacterium strains but are absent not only from the few well-characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, but also are absent from all {\textdollar \textbackslash sim\textdollar }30 000 sequenced M. tuberculosis strains.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Identification of small molecules is a critical task in various areas of life science. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the collection of tandem mass spectra of small molecules from hundreds of thousands of environments. To identify which molecules are present in a sample, one can search mass spectra collected from the sample against millions of molecular structures in small molecule databases. The existing approaches are based on chemistry domain knowledge, and they fail to explain many of the peaks in mass spectra of small molecules. Here, we present molDiscovery, a mass spectral database search method that improves both efficiency and accuracy of small molecule identification by learning a probabilistic model to match small molecules with their mass spectra. A search of over 8 million spectra from the Global Natural Product Social molecular networking infrastructure shows that molDiscovery correctly identify six times more unique small molecules than previous methods.},

  abstract = {Abnormally high expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been implicated in dedifferentiation of radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer (RR-PTC). This study aimed to evaluate the differentiation effect of AhR antagonist in PTC, and to explore the potential mechanism of it. Results showed that AhR antagonists promoted differentiation of PTC, as shown as increase in 125I uptake and Na/I symporter (NIS) expression level. CircRNA microarray in K1 cells treated with StemRegenin 1(SR1) revealed that hsa\textbackslash \_circ\textbackslash \_0006741 (circSH2B3) was down-regulated in SR1 treated K1 cells. Downregulation of circSH2B3 increased 125I uptake and NIS expression levels. CircSH2B3 acted as an endogenous sponge of hsa-miR-4640-5p and modulated IGF2BP2 expression. IGF2BP2 overexpression induced dedifferentiation of PTC, while silencing IGF2BP2 accelerated differentiation of PTC cells. Rescue studies showed that the dedifferentiation activity of AhR was modulated by the circSH2B3/miR-4640-5p/IGF2BP2 axis. Our findings confirmed for the first time that AhR antagonists promote differentiation of PTC via inhibiting the circSH2B3/miR-4640-5p/IGF2BP2 axis, offering a novel therapeutic approach and a potential marker for differentiation of PTC.},

Previous in silico methods search in structure databases but cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect annotations. Here we introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines in silico structure database generation and annotation with a confidence score consisting of kernel density               P               value estimation and a support vector machine with enforced directionality of features. On diverse datasets, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at low false discovery rates and outperforms spectral library search. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated 12 natural bile acids. The annotation of nine structures was confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. In human samples, we annotated and manually validated 315 molecular structures currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Application of COSMIC to data from 17,400 metabolomics experiments led to 1,715 high-confidence structural annotations that were absent from spectral libraries.},

In this work, we present a comprehensive  characterization of the cell-free culture filtrate (CF) and precipitated fraction  (PF) of Bacillus cabrialesii TE3(T) showing an effective inhibition of spot  blotch. Our results indicated that CF produced by B. cabrialesii TE3(T) inhibits  the growth of B. sorokiniana through stable metabolites (after autoclaving and  proteinase K treatment). Antifungal metabolites in CF and PF were explored by an  integrated genomic-metabolomic approach. Genome-mining revealed that strain  TE3(T) contains the biosynthetic potential to produce wide spectrum antifungal  (surfactin, fengycin, and rhizocticin A) and antibacterial metabolites  (bacillaene, bacilysin, bacillibactin, and subtilosin A), and through  bioactivity-guided LC-ESI-MS/MS approach we determined that a lipopeptide complex  of surfactin and fengycin homologs was responsible for antifungal activity  exhibited by B. cabrialesii TE3(T) against the studied phytopathogen. In  addition, our results demonstrate that i) a lipopeptide complex inhibits B.  sorokiniana by disrupting its cytoplasmatic membrane and ii) reduced spot blotch  disease by 93 \textbackslash \%. These findings show the potential application of metabolites  produced by strain TE3(T) against B. sorokiniana and provide the first insight  into antifungal metabolites produced by the novel Bacillus species, Bacillus  cabrialesii.},

@article{MetfragRelauncRuttki2016,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The in silico fragmenter MetFrag, launched in 2010, was one of the first approaches combining compound database searching and fragmentation prediction for small molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry data. Since then many new approaches have evolved, as has MetFrag itself. This article details the latest developments to MetFrag and its use in small molecule identification since the original publication. RESULTS: MetFrag has gone through algorithmic and scoring refinements. New features include the retrieval of reference, data source and patent information via ChemSpider and PubChem web services, as well as InChIKey filtering to reduce candidate redundancy due to stereoisomerism. Candidates can be filtered or scored differently based on criteria like occurence of certain elements and/or substructures prior to fragmentation, or presence in so-called "suspect lists". Retention time information can now be calculated either within MetFrag with a sufficient amount of user-provided retention times, or incorporated separately as "user-defined scores" to be included in candidate ranking. The changes to MetFrag were evaluated on the original dataset as well as a dataset of 473 merged high resolution tandem mass spectra (HR-MS/MS) and compared with another open source in silico fragmenter, CFM-ID. Using HR-MS/MS information only, MetFrag2.2 and CFM-ID had 30\textasciitilde and 43\textasciitilde Top 1 ranks, respectively, using PubChem as a database. Including reference and retention information in MetFrag2.2 improved this to 420 and 336 Top\textasciitilde 1 ranks with ChemSpider and PubChem (89 and 71\textasciitilde \textbackslash \%), respectively, and even up to 343\textasciitilde Top 1 ranks (PubChem) when combining with CFM-ID. The optimal parameters and weights were verified using three additional datasets of 824 merged HR-MS/MS spectra in total. Further examples are given to demonstrate flexibility of the enhanced features. CONCLUSIONS: In many cases additional information is available from the experimental context to add to small molecule identification, which is especially useful where the mass spectrum alone is not sufficient for candidate selection from a large number of candidates. The results achieved with MetFrag2.2 clearly show the benefit of considering this additional information. The new functions greatly enhance the chance of identification success and have been incorporated into a command line interface in a flexible way designed to be integrated into high throughput workflows. Feedback on the command line version of MetFrag2.2 available at http://c-ruttkies.github.io/MetFrag/ is welcome.},

When these different tumors originate and how they evolve are not known. Here we quantify the somatic evolution of neuroblastoma by deep whole-genome sequencing, molecular clock analysis and population-genetic modeling in a comprehensive cohort covering all subtypes. We find that tumors across the entire clinical spectrum begin to develop via aberrant mitoses as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Neuroblastomas with favorable prognosis expand clonally after short evolution, whereas aggressive neuroblastomas show prolonged evolution during which they acquire telomere maintenance mechanisms. The initial aneuploidization events condition subsequent evolution, with aggressive neuroblastoma exhibiting early genomic instability. We find in the discovery cohort (               n               \textbackslash ,=\textbackslash ,100), and validate in an independent cohort (               n               \textbackslash ,=\textbackslash ,86), that the duration of evolution is an accurate predictor of outcome. Thus, insight into neuroblastoma evolution may prospectively guide treatment decisions.},

Design               We used human associated mice, a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease transplanted with the intestinal microbiota of alcoholic patients and used the prebiotic, pectin, to modulate the intestinal microbiota. Based on metabolomic analyses, we focused on microbiota tryptophan metabolites, which are ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Involvement of the AhR pathway was assessed using both a pharmacological approach and AhR-deficient mice.                                         Results                                Pectin treatment modified the microbiome and metabolome in human microbiota-associated alcohol-fed mice, leading to a specific faecal signature. High production of bacterial tryptophan metabolites was associated with an improvement of liver injury. The AhR agonist Ficz (6-formylindolo (3,2-b) carbazole) reduced liver lesions, similarly to prebiotic treatment. Conversely, inactivation of the                 ahr                 gene in alcohol-fed AhR                 knock-out                 mice abrogated the beneficial effects of the prebiotic.

  abstract = {We present a new update to MetaboAnalyst (version 4.0) for comprehensive metabolomic data analysis, interpretation, and integration with other omics data. Since the last major update in 2015, MetaboAnalyst has continued to evolve based on user feedback and technological advancements in the field. For this year\textquotesingle s update, four new key features have been added to MetaboAnalyst 4.0, including: (1) real-time R command tracking and display coupled with the release of a companion MetaboAnalystR package; (2) a MS Peaks to Pathways module for prediction of pathway activity from untargeted mass spectral data using the mummichog algorithm; (3) a Biomarker Meta-analysis module for robust biomarker identification through the combination of multiple metabolomic datasets and (4) a Network Explorer module for integrative analysis of metabolomics, metagenomics, and/or transcriptomics data. The user interface of MetaboAnalyst 4.0 has been reengineered to provide a more modern look and feel, as well as to give more space and flexibility to introduce new functions. The underlying knowledgebases (compound libraries, metabolite sets, and metabolic pathways) have also been updated based on the latest data from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). A Docker image of MetaboAnalyst is also available to facilitate download and local installation of MetaboAnalyst. MetaboAnalyst 4.0 is freely available at http://metaboanalyst.ca.},

  abstract = {In mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics, rarely more than 30\textbackslash \% of the compounds are identified. Without the true identity of these molecules it is impossible to draw conclusions about the biological mechanisms, pathway relationships and provenance of compounds. The only way at present to address this discrepancy is to use in silico fragmentation software to identify unknown compounds by comparing and ranking theoretical MS/MS fragmentations from target structures to experimental tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). We compared the performance of four publicly available in silico fragmentation algorithms (MetFragCL, CFM-ID, MAGMa+ and MS-FINDER) that participated in the 2016 CASMI challenge. We found that optimizing the use of metadata, weighting factors and the manner of combining different tools eventually defined the ultimate outcomes of each method. We comprehensively analysed how outcomes of different tools could be combined and reached a final success rate of 93\textbackslash \% for the training data, and 87\textbackslash \% for the challenge data, using a combination of MAGMa+, CFM-ID and compound importance information along with MS/MS matching. Matching MS/MS spectra against the MS/MS libraries without using any in silico tool yielded 60\textbackslash \% correct hits, showing that the use of in silico methods is still important.},

Monocytes are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of RA and we therefore evaluated and compared the transcriptomic profile of monocytes isolated from patients on treatment with methotrexate alone or in combination with tocilizumab, anti-TNF{\textdollar \textbackslash alpha\textdollar } or abatacept and from healthy donors. Whole-genome transcriptomics yielded a list of regulated genes by Rank Product statistics and DAVID was then used for functional annotation enrichment analysis. Last, data were validated by qRT-PCR. Abatacept, tocilizumab and anti-TNFa cohorts were separately compared with methotrexate, leading to the identification of 78, 6, and 436 differentially expressed genes, respectively. The upper-most ranked genes were related to inflammatory processes and immune responses. Such an approach draws the genomic profile of monocytes in treated RA patients and lays the basis for finding gene signature for tailored therapeutic choices.},

  abstract = {<jats:p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and malignant type of primary brain tumor in adults. Despite important advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis and biology of this tumor in the past decade, the prognosis for GBM patients remains poor. GBM is characterized by aggressive biological behavior and high degrees of inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity. Increased understanding of the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of GBM may not only help more accurately define specific subgroups for precise diagnosis but also lay the groundwork for the successful implementation of targeted therapy. Herein, we systematically review the key achievements in the understanding of GBM molecular pathogenesis, mechanisms, and biomarkers in the past decade. We discuss the advances in the molecular pathology of GBM, including genetics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, and signaling pathways. We also review the molecular biomarkers that have potential clinical roles. Finally, new strategies, current challenges, and future directions for discovering new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for GBM will be discussed.</jats:p>},

  abstract = {<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Liquid\textendash liquid phase separation (LLPS) is a novel principle for interpreting precise spatiotemporal coordination in living cells through biomolecular condensate (BMC) formation via dynamic aggregation. LLPS changes individual molecules into membrane-free, droplet-like BMCs with specific functions, which coordinate various cellular activities. The formation and regulation of LLPS are closely associated with oncogenesis, tumor progressions and metastasis, the specific roles and mechanisms of LLPS in tumors still need to be further investigated at present. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the conditions of LLPS and identify mechanisms involved in abnormal LLPS in cancer processes, including tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis from the perspective of cancer hallmarks. We have also reviewed the clinical applications of LLPS in oncologic areas. This systematic summary of dysregulated LLPS from the different dimensions of cancer hallmarks will build a bridge for determining its specific functions to further guide basic research, finding strategies to intervene in LLPS, and developing relevant therapeutic approaches.</jats:p>},

                  <jats:p>The interaction between tumor and immune system plays a crucial role in both cancer development and treatment response. To facilitate comprehensive investigation of tumor\textendash immune interactions, we have designed a user-friendly web portal TISIDB, which integrated multiple types of data resources in oncoimmunology. First, we manually curated 4176 records from 2530 publications, which reported 988 genes related to anti-tumor immunity. Second, genes associated with the resistance or sensitivity of tumor cells to T cell-mediated killing and immunotherapy were identified by analyzing high-throughput screening and genomic profiling data. Third, associations between any gene and immune features, such as lymphocytes, immunomodulators and chemokines, were pre-calculated for 30 TCGA cancer types. In TISIDB, biologists can cross-check a gene of interest about its role in tumor\textendash immune interactions through literature mining and high-throughput data analysis, and generate testable hypotheses and high quality figures for publication.</jats:p>
