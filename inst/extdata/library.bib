Complicated and error-prone data analysis still remains a bottleneck, however, especially for identifying novel metabolites. Comparing experimental mass spectra to curated databases containing reference spectra has been the gold standard for identification of compounds, but constructing such databases is a costly and time-demanding task. Many software applications try to circumvent this process by utilizing cutting-edge advances in computational methods\textbackslash{}textemdash including quantum chemistry and machine learning\textbackslash{}textemdash and simulate mass spectra by performing theoretical, so called in silico fragmentations of compounds. Other solutions concentrate directly on experimental spectra and try to identify structural properties by investigating reoccurring patterns and the relationships between them. The considerable progress made in the field allows recent approaches to provide valuable clues to expedite annotation of experimental mass spectra. This review sheds light on individual strengths and weaknesses of these tools, and attempts to evaluate them\textbackslash{}textemdash especially in view of lipidomics, when considering complex mixtures found in biological samples as well as mass spectrometer inter-instrument variability.},

  abstract = {Lysophosphatidylcholines are a group of bioactive lipids heavily investigated in the context of inflammation and atherosclerosis development. While present in plasma during physiological conditions, their concentration can drastically increase in certain inflammatory states. Lysophosphatidylcholines are widely regarded as potent pro-inflammatory and deleterious mediators, but an increasing number of more recent studies show multiple beneficial properties under various pathological conditions. Many of the discrepancies in the published studies are due to the investigation of different species or mixtures of lysophatidylcholines and the use of supra-physiological concentrations in the absence of serum or other carrier proteins. Furthermore, interpretation of the results is complicated by the rapid metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in cells and tissues to pro-inflammatory lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly, most of the recent studies, in contrast to older studies, found lower LPC plasma levels associated with unfavorable disease outcomes. Being the most abundant lysophospholipid in plasma, it is of utmost importance to understand its physiological functions and shed light on the discordant literature connected to its research. LPCs should be recognized as important homeostatic mediators involved in all stages of vascular inflammation. In this review, we want to point out potential pro- and anti-inflammatory activities of lysophospholipids in the vascular system and highlight recent discoveries about the effect of lysophosphatidylcholines on immune cells at the endothelial vascular interface. We will also look at their potential clinical application as biomarkers.},

The upper-most ranked genes were related to inflammatory processes and immune responses. Such an approach draws the genomic profile of monocytes in treated RA patients and lays the basis for finding gene signature for tailored therapeutic choices.},

  abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pathogenesis and diagnostic biomarkers for diseases can be discovered by metabolomic profiling of human fluids. If the various types of coronary artery disease (CAD) can be accurately characterized by metabolomics, effective treatment may be targeted without using unnecessary therapies and resources. OBJECTIVES The authors studied disturbed metabolic pathways to assess the diagnostic value of metabolomics-based biomarkers in different types of CAD. METHODS A cohort of 2,324 patients from 4 independent centers was studied. Patients underwent coronary angiography for suspected CAD. Groups were divided as follows: normal coronary artery (NCA), nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis (NOCA), stable angina (SA), unstable angina (UA), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Plasma metabolomic profiles were determined by liquid chromatography\textbackslash{}textendash quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and were analyzed by multivariate statistics. RESULTS We made 12 cross-comparisons to and within CAD to characterize metabolic disturbances. We focused on comparisons of NOCA versus NCA, SA versus NOCA, UA versus SA, and AMI versus UA. Other comparisons were made, including SA versus NCA, UA versus NCA, AMI versus NCA, UA versus NOCA, AMI versus NOCA, AMI versus SA, significant CAD (SA/UA/AMI) versus nonsignificant CAD (NCA/NOCA), and acute coronary syndrome (UA/AMI) versus SA. A total of 89 differential metabolites were identified. The altered metabolic pathways included reduced phospholipid catabolism, increased amino acid metabolism, increased short-chain acylcarnitines, decrease in tricarboxylic acid cycle, and less biosynthesis of primary bile acid. For differential diagnosis, 12 panels of specific metabolomics-based biomarkers provided areas under the curve of 0.938 to 0.996 in the discovery phase (n \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}frac\lbrace{}1\rbrace{}\lbrace{}4\rbrace{}\textdollar{}\rbrace{} 1,086), predictive values of 89.2\textbackslash{}\% to 96.0\textbackslash{}\% in the test phase (n \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}frac\lbrace{}1\rbrace{}\lbrace{}4\rbrace{}\textdollar{}\rbrace{} 933), and 85.3\textbackslash{}\% to 96.4\textbackslash{}\% in the 3-center external sets (n \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}frac\lbrace{}1\rbrace{}\lbrace{}4\rbrace{}\textdollar{}\rbrace{} 305). CONCLUSIONS Plasma metabolomics are powerful for characterizing metabolic disturbances. Differences in small-molecule metabolites may reflect underlying CAD and serve as biomarkers for CAD progression.

Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the collection of tandem mass spectra of small molecules from hundreds of thousands of environments. To identify which molecules are present in a sample, one can search mass spectra collected from the sample against millions of molecular structures in small molecule databases. The existing approaches are based on chemistry domain knowledge, and they fail to explain many of the peaks in mass spectra of small molecules. Here, we present molDiscovery, a mass spectral database search method that improves both efficiency and accuracy of small molecule identification by learning a probabilistic model to match small molecules with their mass spectra. A search of over 8 million spectra from the Global Natural Product Social molecular networking infrastructure shows that molDiscovery correctly identify six times more unique small molecules than previous methods.},

This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.},

  abstract = {The metabolome of an organism depends on environmental factors and intracellular regulation and provides information about the physiological conditions. Metabolomics helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated, since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex. Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions. We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification, and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data. Machine learning methods applied to MS-based metabolomics ease data analysis and can support clinical decisions, guide metabolic engineering, and stimulate fundamental biological discoveries.},

  abstract = {Main risk factors of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include both genetic and non-genetic factors, especially prenatal and perinatal events. Newborn screening  dried blood spot (DBS) samples have great potential for the study of early  biochemical markers of disease. To study DBS strengths and limitations in the  context of ASD research, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of newborns later  diagnosed with ASD. We performed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics on DBS  from 37 case-control pairs randomly selected from the iPSYCH sample. After  preprocessing using MZmine 2.41, metabolites were putatively annotated using  mzCloud, GNPS feature-based molecular networking, and MolNetEnhancer. A total of  4360 mass spectral features were detected, of which 150 (113 unique) could be  putatively annotated at a high confidence level. Chemical structure information  at a broad level could be retrieved for 1009 metabolites, covering 31 chemical  classes. Although no clear distinction between cases and controls was revealed,  our method covered many metabolites previously associated with ASD, suggesting  that biochemical markers of ASD are present at birth and may be monitored during  newborn screening. Additionally, we observed that gestational age, age at  sampling, and month of birth influence the metabolomic profiles of newborn DBS,  which informs us on the important confounders to address in future studies.},

The electrophysiologic basis for these dysrhythmias appears to be heterogeneity of electrical recovery resulting in reentry or enhanced ventricular automaticity. Although the precise mechanisms are unknown, rapid changes in K+, PCO2 and intracellular Ca++ appear to play major roles. In addition, alterations in the regional concentration or tissue compartment localization of amphiphilic lipid metabolites such as lysophosphoglycerides and long-chain acyl carnitines may affect not only the development of dysrhythmia during reperfusion, but also the salvage of ischemic myocardium. Recent experimental evidence in several species also suggests a prominent role of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the evolution of dysrhythmia associated with reperfusion.},

Eucommia ulmoides               is one of the traditional Chinese medicine herbs, which has been used to recover functions of the kidney. However, its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the effects and protective mechanism of               Eucommia ulmoides               extract on renal injury caused by long-term high purine diets in rats. SD rats underwent an intragastric adenine (200 mg kg               -1               d               -1               ) administration for 9 weeks and were treated for 15 weeks. The results demonstrated that               Eucommia ulmoides               extract significantly reduced serum Cre and BUN levels in rats. H\textbackslash{}\&E and Masson's trichrome stains showed notable lowering of the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the formation of fibrous tissues and collagen fibers, and improvement in the pathological morphology of kidneys. It also suppressed the protein and mRNA expressions of TGF-\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}beta\textdollar{}\rbrace{}1 and \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}alpha\textdollar{}\rbrace{}-SMA and enhanced E-cadherin expression. Meanwhile,               Eucommia ulmoides               extract prominently inhibited the mRNA expression of Col I, Col III, Col IV, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 and promoted expressions of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Through our study, it is the first time to prove that               Eucommia ulmoides               extract could ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis and may involve in the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation enzyme (MMPs/TIMPs) system, promotion of the expression of E-cadherin, and suppression of expressions of TGF-\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}beta\textdollar{}\rbrace{}1 and \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}alpha\textdollar{}\rbrace{}-SMA. The results provide a significant implication for the utilization of               Eunomia Ulmoides               extract as functional foods to enhance renal functions and improve renal injury caused by high purine diets.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are increased via unknown mechanisms in patients with diabetes and kidney disease. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into host cells. Because ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of kidney biopsies from healthy living donors and patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell-specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes. Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19-related kidney damage.},

  abstract = {Metabolite identification for untargeted metabolomics is often hampered by the lack of experimentally collected reference spectra from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). To circumvent this problem, Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID) was developed to accurately predict electrospray ionization-MS/MS (ESI-MS/MS) spectra from chemical structures and to aid in compound identification via MS/MS spectral matching. While earlier versions of CFM-ID performed very well, CFM-ID's performance for predicting the MS/MS spectra of certain classes of compounds, including many lipids, was quite poor. Furthermore, CFM-ID's compound identification capabilities were limited because it did not use experimentally available MS/MS spectra nor did it exploit metadata in its spectral matching algorithm. Here, we describe significant improvements to CFM-ID's performance and speed. These include (1) the implementation of a rule-based fragmentation approach for lipid MS/MS spectral prediction, which greatly improves the speed and accuracy of CFM-ID; (2) the inclusion of experimental MS/MS spectra and other metadata to enhance CFM-ID's compound identification abilities; (3) the development of new scoring functions that improves CFM-ID's accuracy by 21.1\textbackslash{}\%; and (4) the implementation of a chemical classification algorithm that correctly classifies unknown chemicals (based on their MS/MS spectra) in \lbrace{}\textdollar{}>\textdollar{}\rbrace{}80\textbackslash{}\% of the cases.

Reference libraries are generated from chemical standards and are therefore limited in size relative to known chemical space. To address this limitation, in silico spectra (i.e., MS/MS or MS2 spectra), predicted via Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID) algorithms, were generated for compounds within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database (totaling, at the time of analysis, \textbackslash{}textasciitilde\textbackslash{},765,000 substances). Experimental spectra from EPA's Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT) mixtures (               n               \textbackslash{},=\textbackslash{},10) were then used to evaluate the performance of the in silico spectra. Overall, MS2 spectra were acquired for 377 unique compounds from the ENTACT mixtures. Approximately 53\textbackslash{}\% of these compounds were correctly identified using a commercial reference library, whereas up to 50\textbackslash{}\% were correctly identified as the top hit using the in silico library. Together, the reference and in silico libraries were able to correctly identify 73\textbackslash{}\% of the 377 ENTACT substances. When using the in silico spectra for candidate filtering, an examination of binary classifiers showed a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.90 associated with false positive rates (FPRs) of 0.10 to 0.85, depending on the sample and method of candidate filtering. Taken together, these findings show the abilities of in silico spectra to correctly identify true positives in complex samples (at rates comparable to those observed with reference spectra), and efficiently filter large numbers of potential false positives from further consideration.},

  abstract = {The urine metabolome constitutes a rich source of functional information reflecting physiological states that are influenced by distinct conditions and  biological stresses, such as responses to drug treatments or disease  manifestations. Although global liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)  profiling provides the most comprehensive measurement of metabolites in complex  biological samples, annotation remains a challenge, and computational approaches  are necessary to translate the molecular composition into biological knowledge.  Here, we investigated the use of tandem MS-based enhanced molecular networks  (MolNetEnhancer) to improve the metabolite annotation of urine extracts. The  samples (n = 10) were analyzed by hydrophilic interaction  chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in both electrospray  ionization (ESI) modes. Consistent with other common data preprocessing software,  the use of Progenesis QI led to the annotation of up to 20 metabolites based on  MS2 library searches, showing a high fragmentation score (cosine similarity \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}geq\textdollar{}\rbrace{}  0.7), that is, \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}sim\textdollar{}\rbrace{}2\textbackslash{}\% of mass features containing MS2 spectra. Molecular networking  based on library matching resulted in the annotation of up to 62 urinary  compounds. Using a combination of unsupervised substructure discovery (MS2LDA),  the in silico tool network annotation propagation (NAP), and ClassyFire chemical  ontology, embedded in a multilayered molecular network by MolNetEnhancer, we were  able to expand the chemical characterization to \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}sim\textdollar{}\rbrace{}50\textbackslash{}\% of the data set. The  integrative approach led to the annotation of 275 compounds at the metabolomics  standards initiative (MSI) confidence level 2, as well as 459 and 578 urinary  metabolites (MSI level 3) in both negative and positive ESI modes, respectively.  The exhaustive MS2-based annotation outperformed similar studies applied to  larger cohorts while offering the discovery of metabolites not identified by the  MS2 library search. This is the first work that effectively integrates orthogonal  annotation methods and MS2-based fragmentation studies to improve metabolite  annotation in urine samples.},

@article{DefiningTheMeZambon2015,
  abstract = {Renewed interest in metabolic research over the last two decades has inspired an explosion of technological developments for studying metabolism. At the forefront of methodological innovation is an approach referred to as "untargeted" or "discovery" metabolomics. The experimental objective of this technique is to comprehensively measure the entire metabolome, which constitutes a largely undefined set of molecules. Given its potential comprehensive coverage, untargeted metabolomics is often the first choice of experiments for investigators pursuing a metabolic research question. It is important to recognize, however, that untargeted metabolomics may not always be the optimal experimental approach. Conventionally, untargeted metabolomics only provides information about relative differences in metabolite pool sizes. Therefore, depending on the specific scientific question at hand, a complementary approach involving stable isotopes (such as metabolic flux analysis) may be better suited to provide biological insights. Unlike untargeted metabolomics, stable-isotope methods can provide information about differences in reaction rates.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fourth round of the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification (CASMI) Contest ( www.casmi-contest.org ) was held in 2016, with two new categories for automated methods. This article covers the 208 challenges in Categories 2 and 3, without and with metadata, from organization, participation, results and post-contest evaluation of CASMI 2016 through to perspectives for future contests and small molecule annotation/identification. RESULTS: The Input Output Kernel Regression (CSI:IOKR) machine learning approach performed best in "Category 2: Best Automatic Structural Identification-In Silico Fragmentation Only", won by Team Brouard with 41\textbackslash{}\% challenge wins. The winner of "Category 3: Best Automatic Structural Identification-Full Information" was Team Kind (MS-FINDER), with 76\textbackslash{}\% challenge wins. The best methods were able to achieve over 30\textbackslash{}\% Top\textasciitilde{}1 ranks in Category\textasciitilde{}2, with all methods ranking the correct candidate in the Top\textasciitilde{}10 in around 50\textbackslash{}\% of challenges. This success rate rose to 70\textbackslash{}\% Top\textasciitilde{}1 ranks in Category\textasciitilde{}3, with candidates in the Top\textasciitilde{}10 in over 80\textbackslash{}\% of the challenges. The machine learning and chemistry-based approaches are shown to perform in complementary ways. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in (semi-)automated fragmentation methods for small molecule identification has been substantial. The achieved high rates of correct candidates in the Top\textasciitilde{}1 and Top\textasciitilde{}10, despite large candidate numbers, open up great possibilities for high-throughput annotation of untargeted analysis for "known unknowns". As more high quality training data becomes available, the improvements in machine learning methods will likely continue, but the alternative approaches still provide valuable complementary information. Improved integration of experimental context will also improve identification success further for "real life" annotations. The true "unknown unknowns" remain to be evaluated in future CASMI contests.

However, most phylogenetic approaches, including maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, cannot scale to the size of the datasets from the current pandemic. We present \textasciigrave{}MAximum Parsimonious Likelihood Estimation' (MAPLE), an approach for likelihood-based phylogenetic analysis of epidemiological genomic datasets at unprecedented scales. MAPLE infers SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies more accurately than existing maximum likelihood approaches while running up to thousands of times faster, and requiring at least 100 times less memory on large datasets. This extends the reach of genomic epidemiology, allowing the continued use of accurate phylogenetic, phylogeographic and phylodynamic analyses on datasets of millions of genomes.},

  abstract = {Machine learning methods and in particular random forests are promising approaches for prediction based on high dimensional omics data sets. They provide variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power. If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways, approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination (RFE). \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}quad\textdollar{}\rbrace{}In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.},

Without the true identity of these molecules it is impossible to draw conclusions about the biological mechanisms, pathway relationships and provenance of compounds. The only way at present to address this discrepancy is to use in silico fragmentation software to identify unknown compounds by comparing and ranking theoretical MS/MS fragmentations from target structures to experimental tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). We compared the performance of four publicly available in silico fragmentation algorithms (MetFragCL, CFM-ID, MAGMa+ and MS-FINDER) that participated in the 2016 CASMI challenge. We found that optimizing the use of metadata, weighting factors and the manner of combining different tools eventually defined the ultimate outcomes of each method. We comprehensively analysed how outcomes of different tools could be combined and reached a final success rate of 93\textbackslash{}\% for the training data, and 87\textbackslash{}\% for the challenge data, using a combination of MAGMa+, CFM-ID and compound importance information along with MS/MS matching.

However, their identification has long been a challenge even with the state-of-the-art analysis technologies like high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) due to their complexity. Emerging               in silico               chemical structure prediction tools have provided time-saving and highly efficient approaches for identification of these complex samples. Nevertheless, the interpretation of these MS annotations into key supporting evidence towards specific questions is still a bottleneck in medicinal and biological fields.

Plantaginis Semen (PS) is commonly used for treating kidney disease and usually stir-fried with salt water to enhance its anti-renal fibrosis effect, but the reason behind this remains unclear. Taking PS as an example, we comprehensively identified and compared the raw and processed PS extracts with SIRIUS-MCnebula, and screened potential anti-renal fibrotic lead compounds using weighted fold change analysis. Eighty-nine components were identified in PS with isoacteoside, calceolarioside B, 2\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\lbrace{}'\rbrace{}\textdollar{}\rbrace{}-acetylacteoside, and plantainoside D being screened and validated to treat renal fibrosis.

  abstract = {The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of in silico predictions. One of the challenges of in silico annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of in silico predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve in silico annotations. The Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) tool is accessible through the GNPS web-platform https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-theoretical.jsp.},

However, TCM contains immense amounts of chemical components. It is a great challenge to objectively evaluate the correlation between the in vivo process and the therapeutic effect of TCM. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the recent investigation (from 2017 to 2019) on preclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of TCM via liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).                                         Method:               We reviewed the published articles regarding the PK of TCM by LC-MS/MS. In addition, we summarized information on PK parameter of bioactive components, single herb and traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions.                                         Results:               The vast majority of literature on preclinical PK of TCM uses single oral administration, the biological matrix is mostly rat plasma, and the main PK parameters include AUC, Cmax, Tmax and T1/2, etc.                                         Conclusion:               Although LC-MS/MS can be used for high-throughput analysis, the characterization of in vivo processes of TCM still has a long way. With the advantages of high sensitivity, high specificity and simple operation, the increasingly mature LC-MS/MS technology will play an important role in the PK study of TCM.},

  abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) is a transcription factor present in immune cells as a long and short isoform, referred to as isoforms 1 and 3, respectively. However, investigation into potential ARNT isoform\textbackslash{}textendash specific immune functions is lacking despite the well-established heterodimerization requirement of ARNT with, and for the activity of, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a critical mediator of immune homeostasis. Here, using global and targeted transcriptomics analyses, we show that the relative ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio in human T cell lymphoma cells dictates the amplitude and direction of AhR target gene regulation. Specifically, shifting the ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio lower by suppressing isoform 1 enhances, or higher by suppressing isoform 3 abrogates, AhR responsiveness to ligand activation through preprograming a cellular genetic background that directs explicit gene expression patterns. Moreover, the fluctuations in gene expression patterns that accompany a decrease or increase in the ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio are associated with inflammation or immunosuppression, respectively. Molecular studies identified the unique casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site within isoform 1 as an essential parameter to the mechanism of ARNT isoform\textbackslash{}textendash specific regulation of AhR signaling. Notably, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ARNT isoform 1 is dependent on ligand-induced AhR nuclear translocation and is required for optimal AhR target gene regulation. These observations reveal ARNT as a central modulator of AhR activity predicated on the status of the ARNT isoform ratio and suggest that ARNT-based therapies are a viable option for tuning the immune system to target immune disorders.},

Previous studies into the classical  pathways of marine microbial metabolism reveal diverse chemistries; however,  metabolic profiling of marine microbes cultured with hydrocarbons is limited. In  this study, taxonomic (amplicon sequencing) profiles of two environmental  deep-sea sediments (\lbrace{}\textdollar{}>\textdollar{}\rbrace{}1,200 m deep) were obtained, along with taxonomic and  metabolomic (mass spectrometry-based metabolomics) profiles of microbes harbored  in deep-sea sediments cultured with hydrocarbons as the sole energy source.  Samples were collected from the Gulf of M\textbackslash{}'exico (GM) and cultured for 28\textbackslash{},days  using simple (toluene, benzene, hexadecane, and naphthalene) and complex  (petroleum API 40) hydrocarbon mixtures as the sole energy sources. The sediment  samples harbored diverse microbial communities predominantly classified into  Woeseiaceae and Kiloniellaceae families, whereas Pseudomonadaceae and  Enterobacteriaceae families prevailed after sediments were cultured with  hydrocarbons. Chemical profiling of microbial metabolomes revealed diverse  chemical groups belonging primarily to the lipids and lipid-like molecules  superclass, as well as the organoheterocyclic compound superclass (ClassyFire  annotation). Metabolomic data and prediction of functional profiles indicated an  increase in aromatic and alkane degradation in samples cultured with  hydrocarbons. Previously unreported metabolites, identified as intermediates in  the degradation of hydrocarbons, were annotated as hydroxylated polyunsaturated  fatty acids and carboxylated benzene derivatives. In summary, this study used  mass spectrometry-based metabolomics coupled to chemoinformatics to demonstrate  how microbes from deep-sea sediments could be cultured in the presence of  hydrocarbons. This study also highlights how this experimental approach can be  used to increase the understanding of hydrocarbon degradation by deep-sea  sediment microbes.IMPORTANCE High-throughput technologies and emerging  informatics tools have significantly advanced knowledge of hydrocarbon metabolism  by marine microbes. However, research into microbes inhabiting deep-sea sediments  (\lbrace{}\textdollar{}>\textdollar{}\rbrace{}1,000 m) is limited compared to those found in shallow waters. In this study, a  nontargeted and nonclassical approach was used to examine the diversity of  bacterial taxa and the metabolic profiles of hydrocarbon-degrading deep-sea  microbes. In conclusion, this study used metabolomics and chemoinformatics to  demonstrate that microbes from deep-sea sediment origin thrive in the presence of  toxic and difficult-to-metabolize hydrocarbons. Notably, this study provides  evidence of previously unreported metabolites and the global chemical repertoire  associated with the metabolism of hydrocarbons by deep-sea microbes.},

  abstract = {We explored potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms regarding multiple benefits after bariatric surgery. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) after bariatric surgery were identified by analyzing two expression profiles from the GEO. Subsequently, enrichment analysis, GSEA, PPI network, and gene-microRNAs and gene-TFs networks were interrogated to identify hub genes and associated pathways. Co-expressed DEGs included one that was up-regulated and 22 that were down-regulated genes. The enrichment analyses indicated that down-regulated DEGs were significantly involved in inflammatory responses. GSEA provided comprehensive evidence that most genes enriched in pro-inflammation pathways, while gene-sets after surgery enriched in metabolism. We identified nine hub genes in the PPI network, most of which were validated as highly expressed and hypomethylated in obesity by Attie Lab Diabetes and DiseaseMeth databases, respectively. DGIdb was also applied to predict potential therapeutic agents that might reverse abnormally high hub gene expression. Bariatric surgery induces a significant shift from an obese pro-inflammatory state to an anti-inflammatory state, with improvement in adipocyte metabolic function - representing key mechanisms whereby AT function improves after bariatric surgery.

To expand our understanding of the molecular features underlying response to checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC, we describe here the first joint analysis of the Stand Up To Cancer-Mark Foundation cohort, a resource of whole exome and/or RNA sequencing from 393 patients with NSCLC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, along with matched clinical response annotation. We identify a number of associations between molecular features and outcome, including (1) favorable (for example,               ATM               altered) and unfavorable (for example,               TERT               amplified) genomic subgroups, (2) a prominent association between expression of inducible components of the immunoproteasome and response and (3) a dedifferentiated tumor-intrinsic subtype with enhanced response to checkpoint blockade. Taken together, results from this cohort demonstrate the complexity of biological determinants underlying immunotherapy outcomes and reinforce the discovery potential of integrative analysis within large, well-curated, cancer-specific cohorts.},

In this work, we present a comprehensive  characterization of the cell-free culture filtrate (CF) and precipitated fraction  (PF) of Bacillus cabrialesii TE3(T) showing an effective inhibition of spot  blotch. Our results indicated that CF produced by B. cabrialesii TE3(T) inhibits  the growth of B. sorokiniana through stable metabolites (after autoclaving and  proteinase K treatment). Antifungal metabolites in CF and PF were explored by an  integrated genomic-metabolomic approach. Genome-mining revealed that strain  TE3(T) contains the biosynthetic potential to produce wide spectrum antifungal  (surfactin, fengycin, and rhizocticin A) and antibacterial metabolites  (bacillaene, bacilysin, bacillibactin, and subtilosin A), and through  bioactivity-guided LC-ESI-MS/MS approach we determined that a lipopeptide complex  of surfactin and fengycin homologs was responsible for antifungal activity  exhibited by B. cabrialesii TE3(T) against the studied phytopathogen. In  addition, our results demonstrate that i) a lipopeptide complex inhibits B.  sorokiniana by disrupting its cytoplasmatic membrane and ii) reduced spot blotch  disease by 93 \textbackslash{}\%. These findings show the potential application of metabolites  produced by strain TE3(T) against B. sorokiniana and provide the first insight  into antifungal metabolites produced by the novel Bacillus species, Bacillus  cabrialesii.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Metabolite identification is an important task in metabolomics to enhance the knowledge of biological systems. There have been a number of machine learning-based methods proposed for this task, which predict a chemical structure of a given spectrum through an intermediate (chemical structure) representation called molecular fingerprints. They usually have two steps: (i) predicting fingerprints from spectra; (ii) searching chemical compounds (in database) corresponding to the predicted fingerprints. Fingerprints are feature vectors, which are usually very large to cover all possible substructures and chemical properties, and therefore heavily redundant, in the sense of having many molecular (sub)structures irrelevant to the task, causing limited predictive performance and slow prediction.                                         Results               We propose ADAPTIVE, which has two parts: learning two mappings (i) from structures to molecular vectors and (ii) from spectra to molecular vectors. The first part learns molecular vectors for metabolites from given data, to be consistent with both spectra and chemical structures of metabolites. In more detail, molecular vectors are generated by a model, being parameterized by a message passing neural network, and parameters are estimated by maximizing the correlation between molecular vectors and the corresponding spectra in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Molecular vectors generated by this model are compact and importantly adaptive (specific) to both given data and task of metabolite identification. The second part uses input output kernel regression (IOKR), the current cutting-edge method of metabolite identification. We empirically confirmed the effectiveness of ADAPTIVE by using a benchmark data, where ADAPTIVE outperformed the original IOKR in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.

  abstract = {Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and conjugated linolenic acids (CLNAs) have gained significant attention due to their anticarcinogenic and lipid/energy metabolism-modulatory effects. However, their concentration in foodstuffs is insufficient for any therapeutic application to be implemented. From a biotechnological standpoint, microbial production of these conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) has been explored as an alternative, and strains of the genera Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium have shown promising producing capacities. Current screening research works are generally based on direct analytical determination of production capacity (e.g., trial and error), representing an important bottleneck in these studies. This review aims to summarize the available information regarding identified genes and proteins involved in CLA/CLNA production by these groups of bacteria and, consequently, the possible enzymatic reactions behind such metabolic processes. Linoleate isomerase (LAI) was the first enzyme to be described to be involved in the microbiological transformation of linoleic acids (LAs) and linolenic acids (LNAs) into CFA isomers. Thus, the availability of lai gene sequences has allowed the development of genetic screening tools. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that LAIs have significant homology with myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) proteins, which are involved in the synthesis of hydroxy fatty acids, as shown by hydratase activity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that CLA and/or CLNA production results from a stress response performed by the activation of more than one gene in a multiple-step reaction. Studies on CFA biochemical pathways are essential to understand and characterize the metabolic mechanism behind this process, unraveling all the gene products that may be involved. As some of these bacteria have shown modulation of lipid metabolism in vivo, further research to be focused on this topic may help us to understand the role of the gut microbiota in human health.},

The aim of pharmacometabonomics is to better understand the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs and monitor the drug effects on specific metabolic pathways. Here, we systematically reviewed the recent technological advances in pharmacometabonomics for better understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases as well as the metabolic effects of drugs on bodies. First, the advantages and disadvantages of all mainstream analytical techniques were compared. Second, many data processing strategies including filtering, missing value imputation, quality control-based correction, transformation, normalization together with the methods implemented in each step were discussed. Third, various feature selection and feature extraction algorithms commonly applied in pharmacometabonomics were described. Finally, the databases that facilitate current pharmacometabonomics were collected and discussed. All in all, this review provided guidance for researchers engaged in pharmacometabonomics and metabolomics, and it would promote the wide application of metabolomics in drug research and personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence methods offer exciting new capabilities for the discovery of biological mechanisms from raw data because they are able to detect vastly more complex patterns of association that cannot be captured by classical statistical tests. Among these methods, deep neural networks are currently among the most advanced approaches and, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to perform excellently for a variety of difficult tasks. Despite that applications of this type of networks to high-dimensional omics data and, most importantly, meaningful interpretation of the results returned from such models in a biomedical context remains an open problem. Here we present, an approach applying a CNN to nonimage data for feature selection. Our pipeline, DeepFeature, can both successfully transform omics data into a form that is optimal for fitting a CNN model and can also return sets of the most important genes used internally for computing predictions. Within the framework, the Snowfall compression algorithm is introduced to enable more elements in the fixed pixel framework, and region accumulation and element decoder is developed to find elements or genes from the class activation maps. In comparative tests for cancer type prediction task, DeepFeature simultaneously achieved superior predictive performance and better ability to discover key pathways and biological processes meaningful for this context. Capabilities offered by the proposed framework can enable the effective use of powerful deep learning methods to facilitate the discovery of causal mechanisms in high-dimensional biomedical data.},

@article{EmpiricalBayesPhipso,
  abstract = {Empirical Bayes is a statistical approach for estimating a series of unknown parameters from a series of associated data observations. It provides an effective means to \textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}borrow strength'' from the ensemble of cases when making inference about each individual case. Such methods are ideally suited to genomic applications where data is collected for tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. Empirical Bayes methods can however be less effective when highly exceptional cases are present. This article proposes a practical solution whereby exceptional cases are identified and the amount of \textasciigrave{}\textasciigrave{}learning'' from the ensemble appropriate for each case is assessed on a case-specific basis. The approach is developed in detail for the problem of estimating genewise variances from microarray data. In this context, the proposed robust empirical Bayes procedure recognizes and protects against hyper-variable genes. The new procedure improves statistical power for most genes in many microarray data sets. Simulations show that the robust estimation procedure correctly controls the type I error rate and does not increase the number of false discoveries when no hyper-variable genes are present. In the presence of hyper-variable genes, the robust method improves power to detect differential expression for the majority of genes that are not outliers. The proposed robust method is applied to an example microarray data set, on which it correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with a hidden covariate and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package which is freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

  abstract = {Medicinal plants are complex chemical systems containing thousands of secondary metabolites. The rapid classification and characterization of the components in  medicinal plants using mass spectrometry (MS) remains an immense challenge.  Herein, a novel strategy is presented for MS through the combination of  solid-phase extraction (SPE), multiple mass defect filtering (MMDF) and molecular  networking (MN). This strategy enables efficient classification and annotation of  natural products. When combined with SPE and MMDF, the improved analytical method  of MN can perform the rapid annotation of diverse natural products in Citrus  aurantium according to the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragments. In MN,  MS2LDA can be initially applied to recognize substructures of natural products,  according to the common fragmentation patterns and neutral losses in multiple  MS/MS spectra. MolNetEnhancer was adopted here to obtain chemical classifications  provided by ClassyFire. The results suggest that the integrated SPE-MMDF-MN  method was capable of rapidly annotating a greater number of natural products  from Citrus aurantium than the classical MN strategy alone. Moreover, SPE and  MMDF enhanced the effectiveness of MN for annotating, classifying and  distinguishing different types of natural products. Our workflow provides the  foundation for the automated, high-throughput structural classification and  annotation of secondary metabolites with various chemical structures. The  developed approach can be widely applied in the analysis of constituents in  natural products.},

  abstract = {Sepsis and septic shock are characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The liver has a central role during sepsis, and is essential to the regulation of immune defence during systemic infections by mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, acute-phase protein or cytokine production and metabolic adaptation to inflammation. However, the liver is also a target for sepsis-related injury, including hypoxic hepatitis due to ischaemia and shock, cholestasis due to altered bile metabolism, hepatocellular injury due to drug toxicity or overwhelming inflammation, as well as distinct pathologies such as secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients. Hence, hepatic dysfunction substantially impairs the prognosis of sepsis and serves as a powerful independent predictor of mortality in the intensive care unit. Sepsis is particularly problematic in patients with liver cirrhosis (who experience increased bacterial translocation from the gut and impaired microbial defence) as it can trigger acute-on-chronic liver failure - a syndrome with high short-term mortality. Here, we review the importance of the liver as a guardian, modifier and target of sepsis, the factors that contribute to sepsis in patients with liver cirrhosis and new therapeutic strategies.},

@article{AN7MethylguanMeiW2022,
  abstract = {Background. Despite the constant iteration of small-molecule inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, PRAD (prostate adenocarcinoma) patients with distant metastases and biochemical recurrence maintain a poor survival outcome along with an increasing morbidity in recent years. N7-Methylguanine, a new-found type of RNA modification, has demonstrated an essential role in tumor progression but has hardly been studied for its effect on prostate carcinoma. The current study aimed to seek m7G (N7-methylguanosine) related prognostic biomarkers and potential targets for PRAD treatment. Methods. 42 genes related to m7G were collected from former literatures and GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) website. Then, RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) and clinical data from TCGA-PRAD (The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate) cohort were retrieved to screen the differentially expressed m7G genes to further construct a multivariate Cox prognostic model for PRAD. Next, GSE116918, a prostate cancer cohort acquired from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database, was analyzed for the external validation group to assess the ability to predict BFFS (biochemical failure-free survival) of our m7G prognostic signature. Kaplan-Meier, ROC (receiver operator characteristic), AUC (areas under ROC curve), and calibration curves were adopted to display the performance of this prognostic signature. In addition, immune infiltration analysis was implemented to evaluate the effect of these m7G genes on immunoinfiltrating cells. Correlation with drug susceptibility of the m7G signature was also analyzed by matching drug information in CellMiner database. Results. The m7G-related prognostic signature, including three genes (EIF3D, EIF4A1, LARP1) illustrated superior prognostic ability for PRAD in both training and validation cohorts. The 5-year AUC were 0.768 for TCGA-PRAD and 0.608 for GSE116918. It can well distinguish patients into different risk groups of biochemical recurrence (                                                   p                                               \textbackslash{},=1e-04 for TCGA-PRAD and                                                   p                                               \textbackslash{},=0.0186 for GSE116918). Immune infiltration analysis suggested potential regulation of m7G genes on neutrophils and dendritic cells in PRAD. Conclusions. A m7G-related prognostic signature was constructed and validated in the current study, giving new sights of m7G methylation in predicting the prognostic and improving the treatment of PRAD.},

Accurate classification of RCC and comprehensive understanding of their metabolic dysregulation are of critical importance. Here we investigate the use of metabolomic analyses to classify the main RCC subtypes and to describe the metabolic variation for each subtype. To this end, we performed metabolomic profiling of 65 RCC frozen samples (40 clear cell, 14 papillary and 11 chromophobe) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. OPLS-DA multivariate analysis based on metabolomic data showed clear discrimination of all three main subtypes of RCC (R               2               \textbackslash{},=\textbackslash{},75.0\textbackslash{}\%, Q               2               \textbackslash{},=\textbackslash{},59.7\textbackslash{}\%). The prognostic performance was evaluated using an independent cohort and showed an AUROC of 0.924, 0.991 and 1 for clear cell, papillary and chromophobe RCC, respectively. Further pathway analysis using the 21 top metabolites showed significant differences in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism between three RCC subtypes. In conclusion, this study shows that metabolomic profiling could serve as a tool that is complementary to histology for RCC subtype classification. An overview of metabolic dysregulation in RCC subtypes was established giving new insights into the understanding of their clinical behaviour and for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Differential expression analysis of genomic data types, such as RNA-sequencing experiments, use linear models to determine the size and direction of the changes in gene expression. For RNA-sequencing, there are several established software packages for this purpose accompanied with analysis pipelines that are well described. However, there are two crucial steps in the analysis process that can be a stumbling block for many -- the set up an appropriate model via design matrices and the set up of comparisons of interest via contrast matrices. These steps are particularly troublesome because an extensive catalogue for design and contrast matrices does not currently exist. One would usually search for example case studies across different platforms and mix and match the advice from those sources to suit the dataset they have at hand. This article guides the reader through the basics of how to set up design and contrast matrices. We take a practical approach by providing code and graphical representation of each case study, starting with simpler examples (e.g. models with a single explanatory variable) and move onto more complex ones (e.g. interaction models, mixed effects models, higher order time series and cyclical models). Although our work has been written specifically with a               limma               -style pipeline in mind, most of it is also applicable to other software packages for differential expression analysis, and the ideas covered can be adapted to data analysis of other high-throughput technologies. Where appropriate, we explain the interpretation and differences between models to aid readers in their own model choices. Unnecessary jargon and theory is omitted where possible so that our work is accessible to a wide audience of readers, from beginners to those with experience in genomics data analysis.},

@article{MetfragRelauncRuttki2016,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The in silico fragmenter MetFrag, launched in 2010, was one of the first approaches combining compound database searching and fragmentation prediction for small molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry data. Since then many new approaches have evolved, as has MetFrag itself. This article details the latest developments to MetFrag and its use in small molecule identification since the original publication. RESULTS: MetFrag has gone through algorithmic and scoring refinements. New features include the retrieval of reference, data source and patent information via ChemSpider and PubChem web services, as well as InChIKey filtering to reduce candidate redundancy due to stereoisomerism. Candidates can be filtered or scored differently based on criteria like occurence of certain elements and/or substructures prior to fragmentation, or presence in so-called "suspect lists". Retention time information can now be calculated either within MetFrag with a sufficient amount of user-provided retention times, or incorporated separately as "user-defined scores" to be included in candidate ranking. The changes to MetFrag were evaluated on the original dataset as well as a dataset of 473 merged high resolution tandem mass spectra (HR-MS/MS) and compared with another open source in silico fragmenter, CFM-ID. Using HR-MS/MS information only, MetFrag2.2 and CFM-ID had 30\textasciitilde{}and 43\textasciitilde{}Top 1 ranks, respectively, using PubChem as a database. Including reference and retention information in MetFrag2.2 improved this to 420 and 336 Top\textasciitilde{}1 ranks with ChemSpider and PubChem (89 and 71\textasciitilde{}\textbackslash{}\%), respectively, and even up to 343\textasciitilde{}Top 1 ranks (PubChem) when combining with CFM-ID. The optimal parameters and weights were verified using three additional datasets of 824 merged HR-MS/MS spectra in total. Further examples are given to demonstrate flexibility of the enhanced features. CONCLUSIONS: In many cases additional information is available from the experimental context to add to small molecule identification, which is especially useful where the mass spectrum alone is not sufficient for candidate selection from a large number of candidates. The results achieved with MetFrag2.2 clearly show the benefit of considering this additional information. The new functions greatly enhance the chance of identification success and have been incorporated into a command line interface in a flexible way designed to be integrated into high throughput workflows. Feedback on the command line version of MetFrag2.2 available at http://c-ruttkies.github.io/MetFrag/ is welcome.},

Specific intestinal microbiota profiles are associated with susceptibility or resistance to alcoholic liver disease in both mice and humans. We aimed to identify the mechanisms by which targeting intestinal microbiota can improve alcohol-induced liver lesions.                                         Design               We used human associated mice, a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease transplanted with the intestinal microbiota of alcoholic patients and used the prebiotic, pectin, to modulate the intestinal microbiota. Based on metabolomic analyses, we focused on microbiota tryptophan metabolites, which are ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Involvement of the AhR pathway was assessed using both a pharmacological approach and AhR-deficient mice.                                         Results                                Pectin treatment modified the microbiome and metabolome in human microbiota-associated alcohol-fed mice, leading to a specific faecal signature. High production of bacterial tryptophan metabolites was associated with an improvement of liver injury. The AhR agonist Ficz (6-formylindolo (3,2-b) carbazole) reduced liver lesions, similarly to prebiotic treatment. Conversely, inactivation of the                 ahr                 gene in alcohol-fed AhR                 knock-out                 mice abrogated the beneficial effects of the prebiotic. Importantly, patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis have low levels of bacterial tryptophan derivatives that are AhR agonists.

@article{ExploringOpenShaB2019,
  abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large and diverse class of chemicals of great interest due to their wide commercial applicability, as well  as increasing public concern regarding their adverse impacts. A common  terminology for PFASs was recommended in 2011, including broad categorization and  detailed naming for many PFASs with rather simple molecular structures. Recent  advancements in chemical analysis have enabled identification of a wide variety  of PFASs that are not covered by this common terminology. The resulting  inconsistency in categorizing and naming of PFASs is preventing efficient  assimilation of reported information. This article explores how a combination of  expert knowledge and cheminformatics approaches could help address this challenge  in a systematic manner. First, the "splitPFAS" approach was developed to  systematically subdivide PFASs (for eventual categorization) following a  C(n)F(2n+1)-X-R pattern into their various parts, with a particular focus on 4  PFAS categories where X is CO, SO(2), CH(2) and CH(2)CH(2). Then, the open,  ontology-based "ClassyFire" approach was tested for potential applicability to  categorizing and naming PFASs using five scenarios of original and simplified  structures based on the "splitPFAS" output. This workflow was applied to a set of  770 PFASs from the latest OECD PFAS list. While splitPFAS categorized PFASs as  intended, the ClassyFire results were mixed. These results reveal that open  cheminformatics approaches have the potential to assist in categorizing PFASs in  a consistent manner, while much development is needed for future systematic  naming of PFASs. The "splitPFAS" tool and related code are publicly available,  and include options to extend this proof-of-concept to encompass further PFASs in  the future.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Advances in genome sequencing have produced hundreds of thousands of bacterial genome sequences, many of which have integrated prophages derived from temperate bacteriophages. These prophages play key roles by influencing bacterial metabolism, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, and defense against viral attack. However, they vary considerably even among related bacterial strains, and they are challenging to identify computationally and to extract precisely for comparative genomic analyses. Here, we describe DEPhT, a multimodal tool for prophage discovery and extraction. It has three run modes that facilitate rapid screening of large numbers of bacterial genomes, precise extraction of prophage sequences, and prophage annotation. DEPhT uses genomic architectural features that discriminate between phage and bacterial sequences for efficient prophage discovery, and targeted homology searches for precise prophage extraction. DEPhT is designed for prophage discovery in Mycobacterium genomes but can be adapted broadly to other bacteria. We deploy DEPhT to demonstrate that prophages are prevalent in Mycobacterium strains but are absent not only from the few well-characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, but also are absent from all \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}sim\textdollar{}\rbrace{}30 000 sequenced M. tuberculosis strains.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Metabolomics has shown great potential to improve the understanding of complex diseases, potentially leading to therapeutic target identification. However, no single analytical method allows monitoring all metabolites in a sample, resulting in incomplete metabolic fingerprints. This incompleteness constitutes a stumbling block to interpretation, raising the need for methods that can enrich those fingerprints. We propose MetaboRank, a new solution inspired by social network recommendation systems for the identification of metabolites potentially related to a metabolic fingerprint. Results: MetaboRank method had been used to enrich metabolomics data obtained on cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients suffering from hepatic encephalopathy (HE). MetaboRank successfully recommended metabolites not present in the original fingerprint. The quality of recommendations was evaluated by using literature automatic search, in order to check that recommended metabolites could be related to the disease. Complementary mass spectrometry experiments and raw data analysis were performed to confirm these suggestions. In particular, MetaboRank recommended the overlooked \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}alpha\textdollar{}\rbrace{}-ketoglutaramate as a metabolite which should be added to the metabolic fingerprint of HE, thus suggesting that metabolic fingerprints enhancement can provide new insight on complex diseases.

  abstract = {Significance             Molecular patient stratification and disease subtyping are ongoing and high-impact problems that rely on the identification of characteristic molecular signatures. Current computational methods show high sensitivity to custom parameterization, which leads to inconsistent performance on different molecular data. Our new method, MoSBi (molecular signature identification using biclustering), 1) enables so far unmatched high performance for stratification and subtyping across datasets of various different biomolecules, 2) provides a scalable solution for visualizing the results and their correspondence to clinical factors, and 3) has immediate practical relevance through its automatic workflow where individual selection, parameterization, screening, and visualization of biclustering algorithms is not required. MoSBi is a major step forward with a high impact for clinical and wet-lab researchers.           ,              The improving access to increasing amounts of biomedical data provides completely new chances for advanced patient stratification and disease subtyping strategies. This requires computational tools that produce uniformly robust results across highly heterogeneous molecular data. Unsupervised machine learning methodologies are able to discover de novo patterns in such data. Biclustering is especially suited by simultaneously identifying sample groups and corresponding feature sets across heterogeneous omics data. The performance of available biclustering algorithms heavily depends on individual parameterization and varies with their application. Here, we developed MoSBi (molecular signature identification using biclustering), an automated multialgorithm ensemble approach that integrates results utilizing an error model-supported similarity network. We systematically evaluated the performance of 11 available and established biclustering algorithms together with MoSBi. For this, we used transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data, as well as synthetic datasets covering various data properties. Profiting from multialgorithm integration, MoSBi identified robust group and disease-specific signatures across all scenarios, overcoming single algorithm specificities. Furthermore, we developed a scalable network-based visualization of bicluster communities that supports biological hypothesis generation. MoSBi is available as an R package and web service to make automated biclustering analysis accessible for application in molecular sample stratification.},

Main funding source(s): The National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China                                         Background               \textasciitilde{}Acute heart failure (AHF) is a significant public health problem related to the high mortality and rehospitalization rate of patients. Although drug development is never interrupted, no single drug has been proven to play a decisive role in improving the survival of AHF patients. In China, multi-component traditional Chinese medicine\textasciitilde{}has been widely\textasciitilde{}used to treat AHF. As a Chinese herbal injection included in medical insurance, Yiqi Fumai Injection can reduce the level of NT-proBNP in AHF patients, improve heart function, and alleviate symptoms and signs related to heart failure. To further evaluate the therapeutic effect of Yiqi Fumai Injection on AHF, a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial that intends to recruit 1270 patients is being carried out in China. However, the mechanism of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF has not been clarified. To further explore\textasciitilde{}the underlying mechanism, we used\textasciitilde{}systematic pharmacology methods to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of biologically active compounds.                                         Methods               \textasciitilde{}We used the databases of HERB, the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM), the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and GeneCards to predict the active ingredients and potential targets of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF. STRING was used for PPI network construction and analysis. Cytoscape was used to build a network between Chinese medicine, ingredients and targets. The DAVID, GO, and KEGG databases were used to predict the potential pathways of Yiqi Fumai Injection for the treatment of AHF.                                         Results               \textasciitilde{}We obtained 31 active compounds of Yiqi Fumai Injection from HERB and ECTM databases. By overlapping targets between YQFMI and AHF, a total of 240 potential targets for Yiqi Fumai Injection to treat AHF were selected.\textasciitilde{}According to the H-C-T network topology analysis, the core compounds include beta-sitosterol, Uridine, Guanosine, and Stigmasterol. Sixteen protein targets had significantly higher node degrees than the average in the PPI network, including AKT1, JUN, TNF, EDN1, CASP3, ESR1, DLG4, PTGS2, NOS3, IL1B, C3, AR, LEP, CNR1, CHRM2, and DRD2. The PPI results showed that the potential therapeutic targets of YQFMI were densely enriched in pathways related to endothelial function, neuromodulation, and lipid metabolism.The same results were shown in GO and KEGG pathway enrichment.                                         Conclusion               \textasciitilde{}Our results indicate that Yiqi Fumai Injection may achieve the goal of improving AHF-related symptoms by regulating the function of vascular endothelium and nerves and the biosynthetic pathway of lipid metabolism. These findings support previous studies and provide a reference for studying the mechanism of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF. Abstract Figure.},

It may also lower serum L-carnitine that supports the use of L-carnitine supplementation as a treatment to ameliorate several of these metabolic consequences. METHODS: To further understand the association between L-carnitine-induced changes in serum acylcarnitines, fatty acid metabolism and survival, serum samples from (T0), 12\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mkern1mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}hfollowing completion (T24) of L-carnitine (n\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mkern1mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}=\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mkern1mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}16) or placebo (n\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mkern1mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}=\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mkern1mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}15) administration, and 48\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mkern1mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}h (T48) after enrollment from patients with septic shock enrolled in a randomized control trial were assayed for acylcarnitines, free fatty acids, and insulin. Data were analyzed comparing 1-year survivors and nonsurvivors within treatment groups. RESULTS: Mortality was 8 of 16 (50\textbackslash{}\%) and 12 of 15 (80\textbackslash{}\%) at 1 year for L-carnitine and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Free carnitine, C2, C3, and C8 acylcarnitines were higher among nonsurvivors at enrollment. L-Carnitine treatment increased levels of all measured acylcarnitines; an effect that was sustained for at least 36\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mkern1mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}h following completion of the infusion and was more prominent among nonsurvivors. Several fatty acids followed a similar, though less consistent pattern. Glucose, lactate, and insulin levels did not differ based on survival or treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: In human patients with septic shock, L-Carnitine supplementation increases a broad range of acylcarnitine concentrations that persist after cessation of infusion, demonstrating both immediate and sustained effects on the serum metabolome. Nonsurvivors demonstrate a distinct metabolic response to L-carnitine compared with survivors, which may indicate preexisting or more profound metabolic derangement that constrains any beneficial response to treatment.},

  abstract = {Astrocytes have important roles in the central nervous system (CNS) during health and disease. Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-Is) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered interferon (IFN)-\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}beta\textdollar{}\rbrace{} are partly mediated by AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AHR agonists that have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate, indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde, or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AHR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-Is produced in the CNS function in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AHR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.},

All database entries are now 'is\textbackslash{}\_a' classified within the ontology, meaning that all of the chemicals are available to semantic reasoning tools that harness the classification hierarchy. We have completely aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO), and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds. We have incorporated additional data types including reference citations, and the species and component for metabolites. Finally, our website and web services have had several enhancements, most notably the provision of a dynamic new interactive graph-based ontology visualization.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Chromatin features are widely used for genome-scale mapping of enhancers. However, discriminating active enhancers from other               cis               -regulatory elements, predicting enhancer strength and identifying their target genes is challenging. Here we establish histone H2B N-terminus multisite lysine acetylation (H2BNTac) as a signature of active enhancers. H2BNTac prominently marks candidate active enhancers and a subset of promoters and discriminates them from ubiquitously active promoters. Two mechanisms underlie the distinct H2BNTac specificity: (1) unlike H3K27ac, H2BNTac is specifically catalyzed by CBP/p300; (2) H2A\textbackslash{}textendash H2B, but not H3\textbackslash{}textendash H4, are rapidly exchanged through transcription-induced nucleosome remodeling. H2BNTac-positive candidate enhancers show a high validation rate in orthogonal enhancer activity assays and a vast majority of endogenously active enhancers are marked by H2BNTac and H3K27ac. Notably, H2BNTac intensity predicts enhancer strength and outperforms current state-of-the-art models in predicting CBP/p300 target genes. These findings have broad implications for generating fine-grained enhancer maps and modeling CBP/p300-dependent gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Serum lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is described to decline in patients with chronic liver diseases. Here it was evaluated which of the LPC species are associated with liver function. LPC species were quantified by direct flow-injection electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in serum of 45 patients with mainly alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC is 52.1 (31.7-110.0) \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}mol/l in serum of patients with CHILD-PUGH score C (decompensated liver cirrhosis) and significantly lower compared to patients with well-compensated disease (CHILD-PUGH score A) with 114.1 (12.3-401.4) \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}mol/l. Mono- and polyunsaturated LPC are not changed in these groups. Saturated LPC is negatively correlated with the model for end-stage liver disease score, bilirubin and galectin-3 and positively with Quick prothrombin time. Ascites and varices are complications of liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC does, however, not correlate with hepatic venous pressure gradient, ascites volume and variceal size. Unexpectedly, saturated LPC measured in serum of 42 patients declines from 88.4 (27.8-177.5) \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}mol/l to 72.4 (27.6-141.8) \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}mol/l shortly after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt implantation. Hepatic vein saturated LPC (82.3 (12.4-161.7) \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}mol/l) is higher than portal vein levels (78.8 (10.1-161.0) \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}mu\textdollar{}\rbrace{}mol/l) suggesting hepatic release of this lipid species. Current data demonstrate that systemic saturated LPC species are reduced in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis and associated with mortality risk.},

  abstract = {Excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased de novo lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}beta\textdollar{}\rbrace{}-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs ex vivo in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

  abstract = {As the major component of cell membranes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized de novo in the Kennedy pathway and then undergoes extensive deacylation-reacylation remodeling via Lands' cycle. The re-acylation is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) and among the four LPCAT members in human, the LPCAT3 preferentially introduces polyunsaturated acyl onto the sn-2 position of lysophosphatidylcholine, thereby modulating the membrane fluidity and membrane protein functions therein. Combining the x-ray crystallography and the cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of LPCAT3 in apo-, acyl donor-bound, and acyl receptor-bound states. A reaction chamber was revealed in the LPCAT3 structure where the lysophosphatidylcholine and arachidonoyl-CoA were positioned in two tunnels connected near to the catalytic center. A side pocket was found expanding the tunnel for the arachidonoyl CoA and holding the main body of arachidonoyl. The structural and functional analysis provides the basis for the re-acylation of lysophosphatidylcholine and the substrate preference during the reactions.},

  abstract = {A toxicogenomics approach was used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the gene expression changes in human and rat primary hepatocytes exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Hepatocytes from five individual rats and five individual humans were exposed for 24 h to 11 concentrations of TCDD ranging from 0.00001 to 100nM and a vehicle control. Gene expression changes were analyzed using whole-genome microarrays containing 13,002 orthologs. Significant changes in expression of individual orthologs at any concentration (fold change [FC] \lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}pm\textdollar{}\rbrace{} 1.5 and false discovery rate \lbrace{}\textdollar{}<\textdollar{}\rbrace{} 0.05) were higher in the rat (1547) compared with human hepatocytes (475). Only 158 differentially expressed orthologs were common between rats and humans. Enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed orthologs in each species with 49 and 34 enriched human and rat pathways, respectively. Only 12 enriched pathways were shared between the two species. The results demonstrate significant cross-species differences in expression at both the gene and pathway level. Benchmark dose analysis of gene expression changes showed an average 18-fold cross-species difference in potency among differentially expressed orthologs with the rat more sensitive than the human. Similar cross-species differences in potency were observed for signaling pathways. Using the maximum FC in gene expression as a measure of efficacy, the human hepatocytes showed on average a 20\textbackslash{}\% lower efficacy among the individual orthologs showing differential expression. The results provide evidence for divergent cross-species gene expression changes in response to TCDD and are consistent with epidemiological and clinical evidence showing humans to be less sensitive to TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity.},

  abstract = {Momordica plant species (Cucurbitaceae), have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and for nutritional purposes. Plants from this family are  thus claimed to be phytochemically rich, representing an inexhaustible source of  natural products. However, the chemical space of these Momordica species has not  yet been fully decoded, and due to the inherent complexity of plant metabolomes,  the characterization of the Momordica phytochemistry remains challenging. Thus,  in this study we propose the use of molecular networking to unravel the molecular  families within the metabolomes of four Momordica species (M. cardiospermoides,  M. balsamina, M. charantia and M. foetida) and highlight the relevance of  molecular networking in exploring the chemotaxonomy of these plants. In silico  annotation tools (Network Annotation Propagation and DEREPLICATOR) and an  unsupervised substructure identification tool (MS2LDA) were also explored to  complement the classical molecular networking output and integration using  MolNetEnhancer within GNPS. This allowed for the visualisation of chemical  classes and the variety of substructures within the molecular families. The use  of computational tools in this study highlighted various classes of metabolites,  such as a wide range of flavonoids, terpenoids and lipids. Herein, these species  are revealed to be phytochemically rich plants consisting of many biologically  active metabolites differentially distributed within the different species, with  the metabolome of M. cardiospermoides dereplicated in this paper for the first  time.},

We apply this four-dimensional technology to profile the spatially resolved landscapes of sterol lipids in ten functional regions of the mouse brain, and quantitatively uncover \textbackslash{}textasciitilde 200 sterol lipids uniquely distributed in specific regions with concentrations spanning up to 8 orders of magnitude. Further spatial analysis pinpoints age-associated differences in region-specific sterol lipid metabolism, revealing changes in the numbers of altered sterol lipids, concentration variations, and age-dependent coregulation networks. These findings will contribute to our understanding of abnormal sterol lipid metabolism and its role in brain diseases.},

While restriction enzymes have advanced genomic analysis, and trypsin has advanced proteomic analysis, there has been no equivalent enzyme for universal polysaccharide digestion. We describe the development and application of a chemical method for producing oligosaccharides from polysaccharides. The released oligosaccharides are characterized by advanced liquid chromatography\textbackslash{}textendash mass spectrometry (LC\textbackslash{}textendash MS) methods with high sensitivity, accuracy and throughput. The technique is first used to identify polysaccharides by oligosaccharide fingerprinting. Next, the polysaccharide compositions of food and feces are determined, further illustrating the utility of technique in food and clinical studies.},

Transcriptional activity of LXRs is induced in response to elevated cellular levels of cholesterol. LXRs bind to and regulate the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in cholesterol absorption, transport, efflux, excretion and conversion to bile acids. The coordinated, tissue-specific actions of the LXR pathway maintain systemic cholesterol homeostasis and regulate immune and inflammatory responses. LXRs also regulate fatty acid metabolism by controlling the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and regulate genes that encode proteins involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation. LXRs exert important effects on the metabolism of phospholipids, which, along with cholesterol, are major constituents of cellular membranes. LXR activation preferentially drives the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids by inducing transcription of the remodelling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3. The ability of the LXR pathway to couple cellular sterol levels with the saturation of fatty acids in membrane phospholipids has implications for several physiological processes, including lipoprotein production, dietary lipid absorption and intestinal stem cell proliferation. Understanding how LXRs regulate membrane composition and function might provide new therapeutic insight into diseases associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer.},

Several methods have been proposed and continue to be used. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the best gene expression quantification method for RNA-seq data analysis.                                         Methods               In the present study, we used replicate samples from each of 20 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models spanning 15 tumor types, for a total of 61 human tumor xenograft samples available through the NCI patient-derived model repository (PDMR). We compared the reproducibility across replicate samples based on TPM (transcripts per million), FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped), and normalized counts using coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and cluster analysis.                                         Results               Our results revealed that hierarchical clustering on normalized count data tended to group replicate samples from the same PDX model together more accurately than TPM and FPKM data. Furthermore, normalized count data were observed to have the lowest median coefficient of variation (CV), and highest intraclass correlation (ICC) values across all replicate samples from the same model and for the same gene across all PDX models compared to TPM and FPKM data.                                         Conclusion               We provided compelling evidence for a preferred quantification measure to conduct downstream analyses of PDX RNA-seq data. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of RNA-seq data quantification measures conducted on PDX models, which are known to be inherently more variable than cell line models. Our findings are consistent with what others have shown for human tumors and cell lines and add further support to the thesis that normalized counts are the best choice for the analysis of RNA-seq data across samples.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Molecular networking connects mass spectra of molecules based on the similarity of their fragmentation patterns. However, during ionization, molecules commonly form multiple ion species with different fragmentation behavior. As a result, the fragmentation spectra of these ion species often remain unconnected in tandem mass spectrometry-based molecular networks, leading to redundant and disconnected sub-networks of the same compound classes. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop Ion Identity Molecular Networking (IIMN) that integrates chromatographic peak shape correlation analysis into molecular networks to connect and collapse different ion species of the same molecule. The new feature relationships improve network connectivity for structurally related molecules, can be used to reveal unknown ion-ligand complexes, enhance annotation within molecular networks, and facilitate the expansion of spectral reference libraries. IIMN is integrated into various open source feature finding tools and the GNPS environment. Moreover, IIMN-based spectral libraries with a broad coverage of ion species are publicly available.},

@article{MinesOpenAccJeffry2015,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In spite of its great promise, metabolomics has proven difficult to execute in an untargeted and generalizable manner. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has made it possible to gather data on thousands of cellular metabolites. However, matching metabolites to their spectral features continues to be a bottleneck, meaning that much of the collected information remains uninterpreted and that new metabolites are seldom discovered in untargeted studies. These challenges require new approaches that consider compounds beyond those available in curated biochemistry databases. DESCRIPTION: Here we present Metabolic In silico Network Expansions (MINEs), an extension of known metabolite databases to include molecules that have not been observed, but are likely to occur based on known metabolites and common biochemical reactions. We utilize an algorithm called the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE) and expert-curated reaction rules based on the Enzyme Commission classification system to propose the novel chemical structures and reactions that comprise MINE databases. Starting from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) COMPOUND database, the MINE contains over 571,000 compounds, of which 93\textbackslash{}\% are not present in the PubChem database. However, these MINE compounds have on average higher structural similarity to natural products than compounds from KEGG or PubChem. MINE databases were able to propose annotations for 98.6\textbackslash{}\% of a set of 667 MassBank spectra, 14\textbackslash{}\% more than KEGG alone and equivalent to PubChem while returning far fewer candidates per spectra than PubChem (46 vs. 1715 median candidates). Application of MINEs to LC-MS accurate mass data enabled the identity of an unknown peak to be confidently predicted. CONCLUSIONS: MINE databases are freely accessible for non-commercial use via user-friendly web-tools at http://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov and developer-friendly APIs. MINEs improve metabolomics peak identification as compared to general chemical databases whose results include irrelevant synthetic compounds. Furthermore, MINEs complement and expand on previous in silico generated compound databases that focus on human metabolism. We are actively developing the database; future versions of this resource will incorporate transformation rules for spontaneous chemical reactions and more advanced filtering and prioritization of candidate structures.

The methods for accessing the database are shown on the right.},

Biliary secretion of bile acids generates bile flow and facilitates hepatobiliary secretion of lipids, lipophilic metabolites, and xenobiotics. In the intestine, bile acids are essential for the absorption, transport, and metabolism of dietary fats and lipid-soluble vitamins. Extensive research in the last 2 decades has unveiled new functions of bile acids as signaling molecules and metabolic integrators. The bile acid-activated nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, vitamin D receptor, and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor play critical roles in the regulation of lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism, inflammation, and drug metabolism and detoxification. Bile acid synthesis exhibits a strong diurnal rhythm, which is entrained by fasting and refeeding as well as nutrient status and plays an important role for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Recent research revealed an interaction of liver bile acids and gut microbiota in the regulation of liver metabolism. Circadian disturbance and altered gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and obesity. Bile acids and their derivatives are potential therapeutic agents for treating metabolic diseases of the liver.},

Global detection and identification of nontargeted components are desirable in natural product research, for example, in quality control of Chinese herbal medicine. Nontargeted components analysis continues to expand to exciting life science application domains such as metabonomics. With this background, the present review summarizes recent developments in the analysis of minor unknown natural products using LC-MS and mainly focuses on the determination of the molecular formulae, selection of precursor ions, and characteristic fragmentation patterns of the known compounds. This review consists of three parts. Firstly, the methods used to determine unique molecular formula of unknown compounds such as accurate mass measurements, MSn spectra, or relative isotopic abundance information, are introduced. Secondly, the methods improving signal-to-noise ratio of MS/MS spectra by manual-MS/MS or workflow targeting-only signals were elucidated; pure precursor ions can be selected by changing the precursor ion isolated window. Lastly, characteristic fragmentation patterns such as Retro-Diels-Alder (RDA), McLafferty rearrangements, "internal residue loss," and so on, occurring in the molecular ions of natural products are summarized. Classical application of characteristic fragmentation patterns in identifying unknown compounds in extracts and relevant fragmentation mechanisms are presented (RDA reactions occurring readily in the molecular ions of flavanones or isoflavanones, McLafferty-type fragmentation reactions of some natural products such as epipolythiodioxopiperazines; fragmentation by "internal residue loss" possibly involving ion-neutral complex intermediates). \textbackslash{}textcopyright\lbrace{}\rbrace{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Abnormally high expression of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been implicated in dedifferentiation of radioiodine-refractory papillary thyroid cancer (RR-PTC). This study aimed to evaluate the differentiation effect of AhR antagonist in PTC, and to explore the potential mechanism of it. Results showed that AhR antagonists promoted differentiation of PTC, as shown as increase in 125I uptake and Na/I symporter (NIS) expression level. CircRNA microarray in K1 cells treated with StemRegenin 1(SR1) revealed that hsa\textbackslash{}\_circ\textbackslash{}\_0006741 (circSH2B3) was down-regulated in SR1 treated K1 cells. Downregulation of circSH2B3 increased 125I uptake and NIS expression levels. CircSH2B3 acted as an endogenous sponge of hsa-miR-4640-5p and modulated IGF2BP2 expression. IGF2BP2 overexpression induced dedifferentiation of PTC, while silencing IGF2BP2 accelerated differentiation of PTC cells. Rescue studies showed that the dedifferentiation activity of AhR was modulated by the circSH2B3/miR-4640-5p/IGF2BP2 axis. Our findings confirmed for the first time that AhR antagonists promote differentiation of PTC via inhibiting the circSH2B3/miR-4640-5p/IGF2BP2 axis, offering a novel therapeutic approach and a potential marker for differentiation of PTC.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype characterised by hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and fibrosis is still incompletely understood. Herein, we discuss two pivotal aspects of the pathogenesis of NASH. We first analyse the initial mechanisms responsible for hepatocellular damage and inflammation, which derive from the toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in hepatocytes is not the major determinant of lipotoxicity, and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents on liver cells. In particular, the role of free fatty acids such as palmitic acid, cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine and ceramides has recently emerged. These lipotoxic agents affect the cell behaviour via multiple mechanisms, including activation of signalling cascades and death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. In the second part of this review, the cellular and molecular players involved in the cross-talk between the gut and the liver are considered. These include modifications to the microbiota, which provide signals through the intestine and bacterial products, as well as hormones produced in the bowel that affect metabolism at different levels including the liver. Finally, the activation of nuclear receptors by bile acids is analysed.},

The final probabilistic result allows the user to make a final decision about which points in a chromatogram are affected by a chromatographic peak and which ones are only affected by noise. The use of probabilities contrasts with the traditional method in which a binary answer is given, relying on a threshold. By contrast, with the Bayesian peak detection presented here, the values of probability can be further propagated into other preprocessing steps, which will increase (or decrease) the importance of chromatographic regions into the final results. The present work is based on the use of the statistical overlap theory of component overlap from Davis and Giddings (Davis, J. M.; Giddings, J. Anal. Chem. 1983, 55, 418-424) as prior probability in the Bayesian formulation.

Metabolomics detects vastly more metabolic  signals that may be used to precisely define the health status of individuals.  However, many compounds remain unidentified, hampering biochemical conclusions.  Here, we annotate all metabolites detected by two untargeted metabolomic assays,  hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry  and charged surface hybrid (CSH)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry. Over 9,000  unique metabolite signals were detected, of which 42\textbackslash{}\% triggered MS/MS  fragmentations in data-dependent mode. On the highest Metabolomics Standards  Initiative (MSI) confidence level 1, we identified 175 compounds using authentic  standards with precursor mass, retention time, and MS/MS matching. An additional  578 compounds were annotated by precursor accurate mass and MS/MS matching alone,  MSI level 2, including a novel library specifically geared at acylcarnitines  (CarniBlast). The rest of the metabolome is usually left unannotated. To fill  this gap, we used the in silico fragmentation tool CSI:FingerID and the new NIST  hybrid search to annotate all further compounds (MSI level 3). Testing the  top-ranked metabolites in CSI:Finger ID annotations yielded 40\textbackslash{}\% accuracy when  applied to the MSI level 1 identified compounds.

  abstract = {In the past decade, advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have revolutionized untargeted metabolomics analyses. By mining metabolomes more deeply, researchers are now primed to uncover key metabolites and their associations with diseases. The employment of untargeted metabolomics has led to new biomarker discoveries and a better mechanistic understanding of diseases with applications in precision medicine. However, many major pertinent challenges remain. First, compound identification has been poor, and left an overwhelming number of unidentified peaks. Second, partial, incomplete metabolomes persist due to factors such as limitations in mass spectrometry data acquisition speeds, wide-range of metabolites concentrations, and cellular/tissue/temporal-specific expression changes that confound our understanding of metabolite perturbations. Third, to contextualize metabolites in pathways and biology is difficult because many metabolites partake in multiple pathways, have yet to be described species specificity, or possess unannotated or more-complex functions that are not easily characterized through metabolomics analyses. From a translational perspective, information related to novel metabolite biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and drug targets might be sparser than they should be. Thankfully, significant progress has been made and novel solutions are emerging, achieved through sustained academic and industrial community efforts in terms of hardware, computational, and experimental approaches. Given the rapidly growing utility of metabolomics, this review will offer new perspectives, increase awareness of the major challenges in LC-MS metabolomics that will significantly benefit the metabolomics community and also the broader the biomedical community metabolomics aspire to serve.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities, including the deficiencies in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) and glutathione metabolism. Here it is investigated if administration of a mixture of combined metabolic activators (CMAs) consisting of glutathione and NAD+ precursors can restore metabolic function and thus aid the recovery of COVID-19 patients. CMAs include l-serine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nicotinamide riboside, and l-carnitine tartrate, salt form of l-carnitine. Placebo-controlled, open-label phase 2 study and double-blinded phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to investigate the time of symptom-free recovery on ambulatory patients using CMAs. The results of both studies show that the time to complete recovery is significantly shorter in the CMA group (6.6\textasciitilde{}vs 9.3 d) in phase 2 and (5.7\textasciitilde{}vs 9.2 d) in phase 3 trials compared to placebo group. A comprehensive analysis of the plasma metabolome and proteome reveals major metabolic changes. Plasma levels of proteins and metabolites associated with inflammation and antioxidant metabolism are significantly improved in patients treated with CMAs as compared to placebo. The results show that treating patients infected with COVID-19 with CMAs lead to a more rapid symptom-free recovery, suggesting a role for such a therapeutic regime in the treatment of infections leading to respiratory problems.},

@article{BiotransformerDjoumb2019,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of computational tools for metabolism prediction have been developed over the last 20\textasciitilde{}years to predict the structures of small molecules undergoing biological transformation or environmental degradation. These tools were largely developed to facilitate absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies, although there is now a growing interest in using such tools to facilitate metabolomics and exposomics studies. However, their use and widespread adoption is still hampered by several factors, including their limited scope, breath of coverage, availability, and performance. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we have developed BioTransformer, a freely available software package for accurate, rapid, and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction and compound identification. BioTransformer combines a machine learning approach with a knowledge-based approach to predict small molecule metabolism in human tissues (e.g. liver tissue), the human gut as well as the environment (soil and water microbiota), via its metabolism prediction tool. A comprehensive evaluation of BioTransformer showed that it was able to outperform two state-of-the-art commercially available tools (Meteor Nexus and ADMET Predictor), with precision and recall values up to 7 times better than those obtained for Meteor Nexus or ADMET Predictor on the same sets of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, phytochemicals or endobiotics under similar or identical constraints. Furthermore BioTransformer was able to reproduce 100\textbackslash{}\% of the transformations and metabolites predicted by the EAWAG pathway prediction system. Using mass spectrometry data obtained from a rat experimental study with epicatechin supplementation, BioTransformer was also able to correctly identify 39 previously reported epicatechin metabolites via its metabolism identification tool, and suggest 28 potential metabolites, 17 of which matched nine monoisotopic masses for which no evidence of a previous report could be found. CONCLUSION: BioTransformer can be used as an open access command-line tool, or a software library. It is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/djoumbou/biotransformerjar/ . Moreover, it is also freely available as an open access RESTful application at www.biotransformer.ca , which allows users to manually or programmatically submit queries, and retrieve metabolism predictions or compound identification data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Phosphoproteomics integrating data-independent acquisition (DIA) enables deep phosphoproteome profiling with improved quantification reproducibility and accuracy compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based phosphoproteomics. DIA data mining heavily relies on a spectral library that in most cases is built on DDA analysis of the same sample. Construction of this project-specific DDA library impairs the analytical throughput, limits the proteome coverage, and increases the sample size for DIA phosphoproteomics. Herein we introduce a deep neural network, DeepPhospho, which conceptually differs from previous deep learning models to achieve accurate predictions of LC-MS/MS data for phosphopeptides. By leveraging in silico libraries generated by DeepPhospho, we establish a DIA workflow for phosphoproteome profiling which involves DIA data acquisition and data mining with DeepPhospho predicted libraries, thus circumventing the need of DDA library construction. Our DeepPhospho-empowered workflow substantially expands the phosphoproteome coverage while maintaining high quantification performance, which leads to the discovery of more signaling pathways and regulated kinases in an EGF signaling study than the DDA library-based approach. DeepPhospho is provided as a web server as well as an offline app to facilitate user access to model training, predictions and library generation.},

In fact, the galloping rate of data acquisition and sharing of mass spectrometry data has led to the current availability of many tens of terabytes of public data in thousands of human data sets. The systematic reanalysis of these public data sets has been used to build a community-scale spectral library of 2.1 million precursors for over 1 million unique sequences from over 19,000 proteins (including spectra of synthetic peptides). However, it has remained challenging to find and inspect spectra of peptides covering functional protein regions or matching novel proteins. ProteinExplorer addresses these challenges with an intuitive interface mapping tens of millions of identifications to functional sites on nearly all human proteins while maintaining provenance for every identification back to the original data set and data file. Additionally, ProteinExplorer facilitates the selection and inspection of HPP-compliant peptides whose spectra can be matched to spectra of synthetic peptides and already includes HPP-compliant evidence for 107 missing (PE2, PE3, and PE4) and 23 dubious (PE5) proteins. Finally, ProteinExplorer allows users to rate spectra and to contribute to a community library of peptides entitled PrEdict (Protein Existance dictionary) mapping to novel proteins but whose preliminary identities have not yet been fully established with community-scale false discovery rates and synthetic peptide spectra.

To  expedite its bioactivity screening we developed a natural products library. Sixty  strains and four environmental samples were chromatographed, using a  semiautomatic HPLC system, yielding 512 fractions that were tested for their  cytotoxic activity against 2D and 3D models of human colon carcinoma (HCT 116),  and non-cancerous cell line hCMEC/D3. Six fractions showed high cytotoxicity  against 2D and 3D cell models (group A), and six other fractions were selected by  their effects on 3D cells (group B). The metabolome of each group was organized  and characterized using the MolNetEnhancer workflow, and its processing with  MetaboAnalyst allowed discrimination of the mass features with the highest fold  change, and thus the ones that might be bioactive. Of those, mass features  without precedented identification were mostly found in group A, indicating seven  possible novel bioactive molecules, alongside in silico putative annotation of  five cytotoxic compounds. Manual dereplication of group B tentatively identified  nine pheophytin and pheophorbide derivatives. Our approach enabled the selection  of 7 out of 60 cyanobacterial strains for anticancer drug discovery, providing  new data concerning the chemical composition of these cyanobacteria.},

The chemical variety of BAs, to a large extent determined by the gut microbiome, also allows for a complex fine-tuning of adaptive responses in our body. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms by which BA receptors coordinate several aspects of physiology and highlights new therapeutic strategies for diseases underlying pathological BA signaling.},

@article{EvaluatingTheLiQi2021,
  abstract = {Cornus officinalis Sieb et. Zucc and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. have exhibited favorable therapeutic effects against rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the specific mechanisms of their active compounds remain unclear. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the therapeutic mechanisms of selected active compounds in Cornus officinalis (loganin, ursolic acid, and morroniside) and Paeonia lactiflora (paeoniflorin and albiflorin) via network pharmacology. The pharmacological properties of the five active compounds were evaluated and their potential target genes were identified by database screening. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional analysis were performed to determine the enriched molecular pathways associated with the active compounds. Using network pharmacology tools, eight genes (IL1\lbrace{}\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}beta\textdollar{}\rbrace{}, VEGFA, STAT3, TP53, IL6, TNF, FOS, and LGALS3) were identified as common targets between RA and the five active compounds. Molecular docking simulation revealed the compound-target relationship between the five active compounds and three selected targets from the eight common ones (LGALS3, STAT3, and VEGFA). The compound-target relationships were subsequently validated via preliminary               in vivo               experiments in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis. Rats subjected to collagen-induced arthritis showed increased protein expression of LGALS3, STAT3, and VEGFA in synovial tissues. However, treatment using Cornus officinalis or/and Paeonia lactiflora, as well as their most drug-like active compounds (ursolic acid or/and paeoniflorin, respectively, identified based on pharmacological properties), attenuated the expression of these three targets, as previously predicted. Collectively, network pharmacology allowed the pharmacological and molecular roles of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia lactiflora to be systematically revealed, further establishing them as important candidate drugs in the treatment and management of RA.},

@article{ImprovingPeakYuTi2014,
  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Peak detection is a key step in the preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data generated from high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The common practice is to use filters with predetermined parameters to select peaks in the LC/MS profile. This rigid approach can cause suboptimal performance when the choice of peak model and parameters do not suit the data characteristics.             Results: Here we present a method that learns directly from various data features of the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) to differentiate between true peak regions from noise regions in the LC/MS profile. It utilizes the knowledge of known metabolites, as well as robust machine learning approaches. Unlike currently available methods, this new approach does not assume a parametric peak shape model and allows maximum flexibility. We demonstrate the superiority of the new approach using real data. Because matching to known metabolites entails uncertainties and cannot be considered a gold standard, we also developed a probabilistic receiver-operating characteristic (pROC) approach that can incorporate uncertainties.             Availability and implementation: The new peak detection approach is implemented as part of the apLCMS package available at http://web1.sph.emory.edu/apLCMS/             Contact: \textasciitilde{}tyu8@emory.edu             Supplementary information: \textasciitilde{}Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Accumulating evidence indicates that the proteasome, a large multisubunit protein deg radative machine in eukaryotes, functions as a processing enzyme responsible for the generation of MHC class I ligands. This processing system is elaborately regulated by various immunomodulatory cytokines. In particular, interferon-gamma induces the formation of immunoproteasomes and a recently identified proteasomal regulatory factor. PA28, which in concert contribute to efficient production of MHC class I ligands. Many of the MHC-encoded genes including LMP appear to have emerged by an ancient chromosomal duplication, suggesting that modifications and renewal of pre-existing non-immune genes were instrumental in the emergence of adaptive immunity.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Neuroblastoma, the most frequent solid tumor in infants, shows very diverse outcomes from spontaneous regression to fatal disease. When these different tumors originate and how they evolve are not known. Here we quantify the somatic evolution of neuroblastoma by deep whole-genome sequencing, molecular clock analysis and population-genetic modeling in a comprehensive cohort covering all subtypes. We find that tumors across the entire clinical spectrum begin to develop via aberrant mitoses as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Neuroblastomas with favorable prognosis expand clonally after short evolution, whereas aggressive neuroblastomas show prolonged evolution during which they acquire telomere maintenance mechanisms. The initial aneuploidization events condition subsequent evolution, with aggressive neuroblastoma exhibiting early genomic instability. We find in the discovery cohort (               n               \textbackslash{},=\textbackslash{},100), and validate in an independent cohort (               n               \textbackslash{},=\textbackslash{},86), that the duration of evolution is an accurate predictor of outcome. Thus, insight into neuroblastoma evolution may prospectively guide treatment decisions.},

@article{SpectralProbabKimS2008,
  abstract = {A key problem in computational proteomics is distinguishing between correct and false peptide identifications. We argue that evaluating the error rates of peptide identifications is not unlike computing generating functions in combinatorics. We show that the generating functions and their derivatives ( spectral energy and spectral probability) represent new features of tandem mass spectra that, similarly to Delta-scores, significantly improve peptide identifications. Furthermore, the spectral probability provides a rigorous solution to the problem of computing statistical significance of spectral identifications. The spectral energy/probability approach improves the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff of existing MS/MS search tools, addresses the notoriously difficult problem of "one-hit-wonders" in mass spectrometry, and often eliminates the need for decoy database searches. We therefore argue that the generating function approach has the potential to increase the number of peptide identifications in MS/MS searches.},

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides-Dipsaci Radix (EU-DR) is a commonly used herbal pair for the treatment of osteoporosis (OP) in China. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential mechanism of EU-DR on OP through network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches. Combining data from multiple open-source databases and literature mining, the active compounds and potential targets of EU-DR were screened out. The OP related targets were identified from the interactive web tool GEO2R. The shared targets were obtained by intersecting the targets of EU-DR and OP. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed via the STRING database and Cytoscape 3.7.2 software. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were conducted using R 3.6.3 software with adjusted p-value \lbrace{}\textdollar{}<\textdollar{}\rbrace{} 0.05. Sybyl-x 2.1.1 and Autodock Vina 1.1.2 software were used to cross validate the affinity between active compounds and target proteins. Our results showed that a total of 50 active compounds were screened, corresponding to 895 EU-DR targets, 2202 OP targets and 144 shared targets. The flavonoids in EU-DR played an important role in anti-OP. The enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG suggested EU-DR exerted a therapeutic effect on OP mainly by regulating the osteoclast differentiation related signaling pathway. Meanwhile, molecular docking results showed that most active compounds in EU-DR had strong binding efficiency to the target proteins. In conclusion, this study elaborated the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway interaction mechanism of the EU-DR herbal pair in the treatment of OP for the first time, which also provided a pharmacological basis for treating OP.},

The aim of this study was to identify the preferred route of penetration of LA and to localize the molecule, using a microautoradiographic technique associated with a compartmental approach. In an in vitro test using topical application of 0.05 g of a formulation containing 1\textbackslash{}\% of LA, 10\textbackslash{}\% of the total recovery was found in the stratum corneum and dermis after 6 h. Microautoradiographic analysis of a 'virtual' slide showed most of the silver grains, i.e. LA, at the hair sheath, and none in the dermal compartment, confirming the diffusion of LA through a preferred transfollicular route. These results show, for the first time on human scalp skin, that the combination of compartmental analysis and microautoradiography points to a preferred transfollicular route of diffusion of topically applied LA. Thanks to its high-resolution, microautoradiography offers the advantage of providing detailed in situ information on the delivery of LA in the skin, including the cellular location of the molecule.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Untargeted metabolomics experiments rely on spectral libraries for structure annotation, but, typically, only a small fraction of spectra can be matched. Previous in silico methods search in structure databases but cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect annotations. Here we introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines in silico structure database generation and annotation with a confidence score consisting of kernel density               P               value estimation and a support vector machine with enforced directionality of features. On diverse datasets, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at low false discovery rates and outperforms spectral library search. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated 12 natural bile acids. The annotation of nine structures was confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. In human samples, we annotated and manually validated 315 molecular structures currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Application of COSMIC to data from 17,400 metabolomics experiments led to 1,715 high-confidence structural annotations that were absent from spectral libraries.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Molecular fingerprints are essential cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping chemical space. Among the different types of fingerprints, substructure fingerprints perform best for small molecules such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for large molecules such as peptides. However, no available fingerprint achieves good performance on both classes of molecules.                                         Results                                Here we set out to design a new fingerprint suitable for both small and large molecules by combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest resulted in a new fingerprint called MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint up to a diameter of four bonds (MAP4). In this fingerprint the circular substructures with radii of                 r                 \textbackslash{},=\textbackslash{},1 and                 r\textbackslash{},                 =\textbackslash{},2 bonds around each atom in an atom-pair are written as two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the topological distance separating the two central atoms. These so-called atom-pair molecular shingles are hashed, and the resulting set of hashes is MinHashed to form the MAP4 fingerprint. MAP4 significantly outperforms all other fingerprints on an extended benchmark that combines the Riniker and Landrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide benchmark recovering BLAST analogs from either scrambled or point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore produces well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases as diverse as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human Metabolome Database (HMBD), and differentiates between all metabolites in HMBD, over 70\textbackslash{}\% of which are indistinguishable from their nearest neighbor using substructure fingerprints.                                                        Conclusion                                MAP4 is a new molecular fingerprint suitable for drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome and can be adopted as a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical space.

@article{ScorpionicidalBrites2021,
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Urban pests pose enormous risks to human health. Control initiatives are carried out in regions of high infestation and incidence of  accidents caused by scorpions OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to analyze the  anti-scorpionic activity of fungal isolates obtained from a cemetery in Brazil.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of thirteen fungi were subjected to a bioassay  test against Tityus serrulatus, and the two isolates with the highest  scorpionicidal activity were selected for molecular identification through  sequencing of the ITS DNA hypervariable region and large-scale cultivation on  liquid medium for secondary metabolite extraction. The crude extracts were  partitioned by solid-phase extraction, and the resulting purified extracts were  tested for anti-scorpionic activity. The extracts from one of the isolates  presented better results and were submitted to UPLC-MS/MS. The metabolomics data  were submitted to GNPS website for Molecular Networking and MASST searches. We  also performed a MolNetEnhancer analysis to identify the chemical classes of the  molecules found in the samples. RESULTS: The most promising fungal isolate was  identified as Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 which has 98\textbackslash{}\% of similarity to  Paecilomyces formosus. The sub-fractions C and D had the best activity against  the scorpions (54 and 32\textbackslash{}\% mortality, respectively). Molecular Networking and  MolNetEnhancer revealed a range of molecular classes in our extracts that are  known to include bioactive metabolites from Paecilomyces species. CONCLUSIONS:  The scorpionicidal activity of Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 and its secondary  metabolites may provide new alternative compounds for biological and chemical  control of scorpions from the species T. serrulatus. Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 is  an isolate that has great potential for isolation of secondary metabolites.},

@article{EnclaveAwareCZahra2020,
  abstract = {  Hardware-assisted trusted execution environments (TEEs) are critical building blocks of many modern applications. However, they have a one-way isolation model that introduces a semantic gap between a TEE and its outside world. This lack of information causes an ever-increasing set of attacks on TEE-enabled applications that exploit various insecure interactions with the host OSs, applications, or other enclaves. We introduce Sirius, the first compartmentalization framework that achieves strong isolation and secure sharing in TEE-assisted applications by controlling the dataflows within primary kernel objects (e.g. threads, processes, address spaces, files, sockets, pipes) in both the secure and normal worlds. Sirius replaces ad-hoc interactions in current TEE systems with a principled approach that adds strong inter- and intra-address space isolation and effectively eliminates a wide range of attacks. We evaluate Sirius on ARM platforms and find that it is lightweight (\textdollar{}\textbackslash{}approx 15K\textdollar{} LoC) and only adds \textdollar{}\textbackslash{}approx 10.8\textbackslash{}\%\textdollar{} overhead to enable TEE support on applications such as httpd, and improves the performance of existing TEE-enabled applications such as the Darknet ML framework and ARM's LibDDSSec by \textdollar{}0.05\textbackslash{}\%-5.6\textbackslash{}\%\textdollar{}. },

This has been fuelled by interest in the  central role that microorganisms play in mediating both interspecies interactions  and host-microbe relationships. To support the study of natural products  chemistry produced by microorganisms we released the Natural Products Atlas, a  database of known microbial natural products structures, in 2019. This paper  reports the release of a new version of the database which includes a full  RESTful application programming interface (API), a new website framework, and an  expanded database that includes 8128 new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552.  In addition to these structural and content changes we have added full taxonomic  descriptions for all microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from  both NP Classifier and ClassyFire. We have also performed manual curation to  review all entries with incomplete configurational assignments and have  integrated data from external resources, including CyanoMetDB. Finally, we have  improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a  dashboard for taxonomic origin. The database can be accessed via the new  interactive website at https://www.npatlas.org.},

Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem MS to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Today, the vast majority of metabolites remain unknown. We present a method for searching molecular structure databases using tandem MS data of small molecules. Our method computes a fragmentation tree that best explains the fragmentation spectrum of an unknown molecule. We use the fragmentation tree to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine learning. This fingerprint is then used to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem. Our method is shown to improve on the competing methods for computational metabolite identification by a considerable margin.},

We identify a major shift between mild and moderate disease, at which point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied by the loss of specific classes of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within this stressed plasma environment at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune cell phenotypes emerge and amplify with increasing disease severity. We condensed over 120,000 immune features into a single axis to capture how different immune cell classes coordinate in response to SARS-CoV-2. This immune-response axis independently aligns with the major plasma composition changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that moderate disease may provide the most effective setting for therapeutic intervention.},

Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process. While waiting for this goal to be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programmes offers the best hope of increasing favourable outcomes.},

A decreased LPC concentration on day 7 to its baseline as well as a sustained high concentration of PCT on day 7 at more than 50\textbackslash{}\% of its baseline value was useful for predicting the 28-day mortality. Prognostic utility was substantially improved when combined LPC and PCT criteria were applied to 28-day mortality outcome predictions. Furthermore, LPC concentrations increased over time in patients with appropriate antibiotics but not in those with inappropriate antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurements of LPC help in the prediction of 28-day mortality in ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.},

  abstract = {Optical chemical structure recognition from scientific publications is essential for rediscovering a chemical structure. It is an extremely challenging problem, and current rule-based and deep-learning methods cannot achieve satisfactory recognition rates. Herein, we propose SwinOCSR, an end-to-end model based on a Swin Transformer. This model uses the Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract image features and introduces Transformer models to convert chemical information from publications into DeepSMILES. A novel chemical structure dataset was constructed to train and verify our method. Our proposed Swin Transformer-based model was extensively tested against the backbone of existing publicly available deep learning methods. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the compared methods, demonstrating the model's effectiveness. Moreover, we used a focal loss to address the token imbalance problem in the text representation of the chemical structure diagram, and our model achieved an accuracy of 98.58\textbackslash{}\%.},

In-depth exploration of the pathogenesis of RA and the development of effective therapeutic drugs are of important clinical and social value. Herein, we explored the medicinal value of Cornus officinalis Sieb. and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. in RA treatment using a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We compared the therapeutic effect of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia lactiflora with that of their main active compounds, ursolic acid and paeoniflorin, respectively. We demonstrated that the combination of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia lactiflora effectively inhibited the release of factors associated with oxidative stress and inflammation during RA, therein ameliorating the symptoms and suppressing the progression of RA. We further showed that the underlying mechanisms may be related to the regulation of apoptosis in synovial tissues, and we investigated the potential involvement of AMPK-mediated mitochondrial dynamics in the therapeutic action of the two drugs and their active components.},

  abstract = {Large-scale metabolite annotation is a challenge in liquid chromatogram-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics. Here, we develop a metabolic reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm (MetDNA) that expands metabolite annotations without the need for a comprehensive standard spectral library. MetDNA is based on the rationale that seed metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbors tend to share structural similarities resulting in similar MS2 spectra. MetDNA characterizes initial seed metabolites using a small library of MS2 spectra, and utilizes their experimental MS2 spectra as surrogate spectra to annotate their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites, which subsequently serve as the basis for recursive analysis. Using different LC-MS platforms, data acquisition methods, and biological samples, we showcase the utility and versatility of MetDNA and demonstrate that about 2000 metabolites can cumulatively be annotated from one experiment. Our results demonstrate that MetDNA substantially expands metabolite annotation, enabling quantitative assessment of metabolic pathways and facilitating integrative multi-omics analysis.},

Herein, we performed multi-platform omics analysis of serial plasma and urine samples collected from patients during the course of COVID-19. Integrative analyses of these omics data revealed several potential therapeutic targets, such as ANXA1 and CLEC3B. Molecular changes in plasma indicated dysregulation of macrophage and suppression of T cell functions in severe patients compared to those in non-severe patients. Further, we chose 25 important molecular signatures as potential biomarkers for the prediction of disease severity. The prediction power was validated using corresponding urine samples and plasma samples from new COVID-19 patient cohort, with AUC reached to 0.904 and 0.988, respectively. In conclusion, our omics data proposed not only potential therapeutic targets, but also biomarkers for understanding the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.},

  abstract = {AutoDock Vina is arguably one of the fastest and most widely used open-source programs for molecular docking. However, compared to other programs in the AutoDock Suite, it lacks support for modeling specific features such as macrocycles or explicit water molecules. Here, we describe the implementation of this functionality in AutoDock Vina 1.2.0. Additionally, AutoDock Vina 1.2.0 supports the AutoDock4.2 scoring function, simultaneous docking of multiple ligands, and a batch mode for docking a large number of ligands. Furthermore, we implemented Python bindings to facilitate scripting and the development of docking workflows. This work is an effort toward the unification of the features of the AutoDock4 and AutoDock Vina programs. The source code is available at https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-Vina.},

@article{NonViolentResShimsh2022,
  abstract = {The goal of this study is to integrate two areas in recent clinical theory, research, and practice: family accommodation and non-violent resistance (NVR). Family accommodation describes changes that family members make to their own behavior, to help their relative who is dealing with psychopathology to avoid or alleviate distress related to the disorder. Rapidly growing research on family accommodation has established its high prevalence and negative impact across disorders and the life span. NVR is a trans-diagnostic treatment approach that helps parents to cope with child externalizing, internalizing, and other problems in non-escalatory ways. This study reviews empirical research on family accommodation and NVR, and argues that the anchoring function of NVR, a central concept reflecting the stabilization of the parent-child relationship, may provide a uniquely suited framework for reducing family accommodation across disorders and development. The study discusses how the anchoring function may be applied to promote accommodation reduction through a detailed description of SPACE (Supportive Parenting for Anxious Childhood Emotions), an NVR-informed treatment for childhood anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.},
