This work contains the results of a study performed with these three compounds, in order to demonstrate their neuropsycholeptic activity in comparison with chloropromazine (CPZ) and chlordiazepoxide (CPD). The inhibition of motility observed in mice shows that the compounds reduce the normal spontaneous motility as well as the muscle tone. The central-depressant activity is evidenced by increased barbiturate-induced sleep and a remarkable eyelid ptosis can also be observed. Our compounds do not show any activity on electroshock just as do CPZ and CPD. As to the antipsychotic outline, our compounds show strong reduction of lethality due to amphetamine in grouped mice and a strong antiapomorphine activity. They show also an antiaggressive effect and an inhibitory activity on avoidance behaviour much stronger than CPZ. We have also found extrapyramidal effects, as catalepsy, common to many tranquillizers of the kind of the standards used by us. As for vegetative phenomena, the compounds show hypotensive dose related action ranging from moderate to strong, probably due to an a-receptor inhibition. Adrenolytic activity against lethal doses of adrenaline, antiserotonin and antihistaminic effects, as well as other actions (hypothermia, analgesia, etc.) confirm that RMI 61 140, RMI 61 144 and RMI 61 280 are endowed with pharmacologic properties similar and more potent than those of CPZ. Studies on the metabolism of brain catecholamines show that they are similar to CPZ, although with less effect on dopamine level.},

Opposite to the necrotic surface the loose part of the  re-covered bark regenerated callus from the phloem ray cells. If the re-covered  part was very close to the necrotic surface, no callus was regenerated. However,  many scattered tracheid-like elements derived from phloem were found. And then  groups of cells including several tracheid-like elements were discernible. There  was a ring of meristematic cells around that group of cells. Finally these  meristems gradually became normal and had usual activities of vascular cambium.},

The electrophysiologic basis for these dysrhythmias appears to be heterogeneity of electrical recovery resulting in reentry or enhanced ventricular automaticity. Although the precise mechanisms are unknown, rapid changes in K+, PCO2 and intracellular Ca++ appear to play major roles. In addition, alterations in the regional concentration or tissue compartment localization of amphiphilic lipid metabolites such as lysophosphoglycerides and long-chain acyl carnitines may affect not only the development of dysrhythmia during reperfusion, but also the salvage of ischemic myocardium. Recent experimental evidence in several species also suggests a prominent role of alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation in the evolution of dysrhythmia associated with reperfusion.},

It showed that in the convalescent  stage, most of the asthmatics still possessed obstruction of airways and chiefly  of small airways. 35 cases of asthmatics in the convalescent stage was given the  Chinese herbal decoction of chiefly invigorating Kidney (Viscum coloratum 15g,  Psoralea corylifolia 15g, Eucommia ulmoides 15g, Lycium chinense 9g, Tussilago  farfara 15g, Artemisia capillaris 9g, and Pogostemon cablin 9g as daily dosage)  for treatment of 10 weeks and measuring MEFV curves to observe their changes  before and after treatment.

In discussion, the authors  indicated that the prompt treatment for asthmatics in the convalescent stage was  conductive early to prevent emphysema and confirmed that the treatment with  Chinese herbs of chiefly invigorating Kidney deserved to be propagated.},

Autofluorescent elastic latex filaments bearing  capitate termini are preserved in nearly all of the remains and provide  conclusive evidence of their affinity to Eucommia. Four species of Eucommia are  recognized on the basis of the characteristic samaras: E. eocenica from middle  Eocene strata of the Mississippi Embayment in Missouri, Tennessee and  Mississippi; E. montana from early Eocene to early Oligocene localities in  British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Colorado, and Montana; E. constans  from Neogene rocks in central Mexico; and E. jeffersonensis n. sp. from the  latest Eocene or earliest Oligocene John Day Formation of Oregon. Atypical  specimens of E. montana and E. eocenica are the first records of two-seeded  fruits for the genus. Eucommia leaves from Eocene localities in British Columbia  and Mississippi are the first records of Eucommia foliage in North America whose  identifications are confirmed by the presence of capitate latex strands. These  leaves and a specimen from Oregon are referred to E. rolandii n. sp. Fruit  evolution in Eucommia may have involved increases in samara size and symmetry,  and reduction in seed number from two to one, perhaps as adaptations for wind  dispersal. All fossil Eucommia samaras from North America are smaller and less  symmetrical than those of the living species, E. ulmoides. Preliminary flight  tests of E. ulmoides samaras and of models of the fossils suggest that E.  ulmoides fruits are aerodynamically better suited for wind dispersal than the  fossils.},

In this paper, we set out to examine  the compounds in Du-Zhong leaves that stimulated collagen synthesis in false aged  model rats. In experiment 1, a methanol extract of Du-Zhong leaves also  stimulated collagen synthesis in aged model rats. An acetone fraction was derived  from the methanol extract by silica gel chromatography in experiment 2. The  acetone fraction mainly contained iridoides mono-glycosides such as geniposidic  acid and aucubin. The administration of geniposidic acid or aucubin stimulated  collagen synthesis in aged model rats in experiments 3 and 4 (significance  (p{$<$}0.05)). The reported pharmacological effects of Du-Zhong leaves, including  healing organs and strengthening bone and muscle, are closely related to collagen  metabolism. It appears that geniposidic acid and aucubin are the actual compounds  in Du-Zhong which caused the effect in our experiments.},

On the twenty-ninth day of  the experimental period, a mandatory endurance running exercise (treadmill, 7  degrees grade) was conducted. Twenty-four hours later, the rats were sacrificed  and the skeletal muscles and other organs were dissected. Due to the training,  the HAD specific activity in the skeletal muscles had increased and a more  oxidative metabolism had developed, which was further enhanced by the  administration of the leaf. In soleus (SOL) muscle in the Eucommia leaf treated  running-training group (ET), the LDH specific activity in the skeletal muscle was  significantly higher than in the sedentary control group (SC). The isozyme  profile of the group ET was significantly different when compared with the group  SC. The changes in the LDH isozyme profile were larger in the SOL than that in  extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. The results show that mechanical training  and the use of the leaf cooperatively increase the ability to avoid lactate  accumulation in skeletal muscle. This effect is supported by the group where 67\%  of rats accomplished the endurance running exercise. Theses results suggest that  the administration of Eucommia ulmoides OLIVER leaf along with light intensity  training enhances the ability of a muscle to resist fatigue.},

In the second experiment, treatment with geniposidic acid similarly caused  a higher turnover rate in the stratum corneum, increasing turnover by 23\%  (p{$<$}0.05, Mann-Whitney) compared to the control value.

The WEDZ used included  leaves, raw cortex, and roasted cortex. All of the WEDZ inhibited the oxidation  of deoxyribose induced by Fe(3+)-EDTA/H2O2/ascorbic acid in a concentration  dependent manner. At a concentration of 1.14 mg/mL, the inhibitory effect of the  extracts of leaves, roasted cortex, and raw cortex was 85.2\%, 68.0\% and 49.3\%,  respectively. The extract of leaves inhibited the strand-breaking of DNA induced  by the Fenton reaction at concentrations of 5 and 10 micrograms/microL. This  inhibitory effect was similar to mannitol whereas the extracts of raw cortex and  roasted cortex had no inhibitory effect at all. WEDZ also inhibited the oxidation  of 2'-dG to 8-OH-2'-dG induced by Fe(3+)-EDTA/H2O2/ascorbic acid. Gallic acid had  a prooxidant effect, but trolox and mannitol had an antioxidant effect. The leaf  extract had a marked inhibitory effect on Fenton reaction induced oxidative  damage in biomolecules. The extract of roasted cortex exhibited modest inhibition  while the extract of raw cortex had the least inhibitory effect on oxidative  damage in biomolecules. This is in contrast to gallic acid in the same reaction  system, whose higher reducing power and weaker chelating ability may contribute  to its prooxidant effect. In the present study, leaf extract of Du-zhong had  inhibitory effect on oxidative damage in biomolecules. Therefore, drinking of  Du-zhong tea (leaf extract) over a long period of time may have anticancer  potential.},

All of them also increased the 2nd harmonic (which is  correlated to the kidney and the kidney meridian) as well as decreased the heart  load (DC term of pressure wave, C0). Tuber Pinelliae, Radix Codonopsitis,  Pericarpium Aurantii and Rhizoma Polygonati decreased the 1st harmonic  (correlated to the liver meridian) significantly, while Rhizoma Atractylodis  Macrocephalae only decreased C1 slightly.

In the case of the collagen profile, the pepsin-solubilized collagen  content and its relative percentage to the total collagen were significantly  higher than in the control.

Granuloma formation and collagen synthesis  were significantly increased by the administration of the methanol extract of  Eucommiae Cortex. The effective component of Eucommiae Cortex was then discussed  by fractionating the methanol extract of Eucommiae Cortex. Eucommiol, a main  component in the water fraction of the methanol extract, was found to be an  effective compound. In our previous paper, we reported the promoting effect of  Eucommia ulmoides OLIVER leaf on collagen synthesis, and found geniposidic acid  and aucubin were the main effective compounds in the leaf. Based on our data in  this paper, we clarified that the main effective components of the Eucommia  ulmoides OLIVER leaf and Eucommiae Cortex were different. Geniposidic acid and  aucubin were reported to be contained at a high concentration in the fresh cortex  of Eucommia ulmoides OLIVER, but during the drying process and storage, most of  them were destroyed by enzymes in the cortex and very little remained in the  Eucommiae Cortex. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the methanol extract  of fresh cortex of Eucommia ulmoides OLIVER. A stronger effect than Eucommiae  cortex was shown, and geniposidic acid, aucubin and geniposide were concluded to  be the main effective components. Although geniposide was found to be an  effective compound, when the dose was higher than 50 mg/kg/d, toxicity was shown.  The pharmaceutical effect of eucommiol was reported for the first time.},

Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for               Halobacterium               , and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

  abstract = {The vascular effects of three extract preparations from the Chinese medicinal herb, Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., which is historically an active ingredient  commonly used in antihypertensive herbal prescriptions in China, were  investigated with isometric contraction using isolated rat aortic and dog carotid  rings. Both aqueous extracts isolated from eucommia leaf (L) and bark (B)  concentration dependently caused endothelium-dependent relaxation in vessels  precontracted with 1 microM phenylephrine (PE), but the methanol extract of the  leaf (M) had no effect. Vessels precontracted with KCl and de-endothelialized  vessels precontracted with PE were not affected by B or L. The  endothelium-dependent relaxation evoked by B and L was either abolished or  substantially inhibited by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and  methylene blue (MB), indicating the involvement of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase  pathway in the vasorelaxant action of B and L. The relaxation to the aqueous  extract of eucommia bark was not inhibited with 1 microM atropine, but was  inhibited by 3-5 mM tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 3 mM 4-aminopyridine. This  suggests that the endothelium-dependent, NO-mediated relaxation evoked by the  aqueous eucommia extracts was not mediated via the activation of endothelium  muscarinic receptors and may involve the activation of K+ -channels. Results in  this study have provided the first evidence on the in vitro vasorelaxant action  of E. ulmoides Oliv. that forms the pharmacological basis for its well-documented  antihypertensive action.},

The proliferation of osteoblast-like cells increased  by herbal extracts was assayed using a tetrazolium (MTT), alkaline phosphatase  (ALP) activity, and [3H]-proline incorporation assays. The inhibition of  osteoclast was studied by using the coculture of mouse bone marrow cells and ST-2  cells. As a result, the GA, GP and AU were present in the cortex more than in the  leaf of E. ulmoides Oliver. The MeOH (1 mg/mL), Hx, CHCl3 and EA fractions (each  20 microg/mL) had potent induction of GH release. The CHCl3 exhibited the potent  proliferation of osteoblasts. The AU, GP and GA were increased proliferation of  osteoblasts. In addition, GA (IC50: 4.43 x 10(-7) M), AU and GP were  significantly inhibited proliferation of osteoclast.

Recently, water extracts of Tochu (Du-zhong,  Eucommia ulmoidea OLIVER) leaves (WETL) have been reported to have potent  antioxidant and antimutagenic effects. The present study investigated the  effect(s) of VC and WETL on gastric mucosal injury induced by ammonia and a VC  deficient diet. Guinea pigs fed the water containing ammonia and/or a  VC-deficient diet were simultaneously treated with WETL or VC. Intramucosal  levels of thiobarubiturate reactive substances (TBARS), an index of lipid  peroxidation, increased significantly in animals fed ammoniated water and  VC-deficient diets. This was accompanied by accelerated cell proliferation and  increases in immunohistochemical staining indices for oxidative stress-induced  DNA adducts and strand breaks (e.g., BrdU-uptake, 8-OhdG, ssDNA and the TUNEL  reaction). The administration of either WETL or VC to the ammoniated water and  VC-deficient diets ameliorated the increases in intramucosal TBARS levels and  labeling indices of BrdU, 8-OHdG, ssDNA and TUNEL, i.e., the levels were similar  to those measured in the normal-fed control animals. These data suggest that  insufficient VC ingestion may be an important risk factor for gastric cancer  development in patients with HP infections. Furthermore, our results suggest that  WETL or some constituent may contribute to the prevention of oxidative gastric  injury that precedes carcinogenesis.},

If the girdled trunk is well  protected from desiccation, new bark forms within 1 month. It has been proposed  that phytohormones play a key role in this process. Research has been conducted  to determine the distribution of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and  abscisic acid (ABA) during the bark recovery, using high-performance  liquid-chromatography (HPLC) and fluoro-immuno-localization techniques. Results  showed that, from 2 d after girdling, the IAA content in the recovering bark (RB)  increased markedly while that of ABA decreased. The opposite pattern was observed  during progressive re-establishment of the tissues. Immuno-localization showed  that most of the IAA was located in the RB tissue layers undergoing cell  division, dedifferentiation and (re)differentiation, such as xylary rays,  immature xylem, phellogen and cambial regions. This study also provides evidence  that IAA and ABA are involved in the bark reconstitution.},

The results showed  that the DNA damage in human lymphocytes increased with an increase in the  concentration of H(2)O(2) (0-200 micro;M), but that the water extracts from  Du-zhong (0-2 g l(-1)) only slightly affected DNA damage. The inhibitory effect  of leaf extract on DNA damage induced by H(2)O(2) in lymphocytes was more  significant (P{$<$}0.05) than that of roasted cortex. Leaf extract showed a rather  significant inhibitory effect in a concentration-dependent manner. At a  concentration of 2 g l(-1), the leaf extract inhibited 37.9\% DNA oxidative damage  in human lymphocytes. In order to elucidate the mechanism of the leaf extract  suppression effect on DNA damage induced by H(2)O(2) in lymphocytes, an  experiment was divided with six groups (A-F). Group A was used to evaluate the  repair ability of the leaf extract for DNA damage; Group B was employed to  determine the scavenging ability on H(2)O(2); and Group C was studied to assess  the ability of leaf extract to increase the defense capability. Groups D-F were  negative controls and blank. The results showed that group B had the best  inhibitory effect. Also, leaf extract had significant ability to scavenge  H(2)O(2) in an in vitro HRP-phenol red test. Thus, it appears that H(2)O(2)  scavenging potency may be the major mechanism whereby leaf extract inhibits  oxidative DNA damage induced by H(2)O(2).},

Spring temperatures in these regions vary from 12.3\textdegree C to  20.1\textdegree C. A physiological study (using germination tests) of E. ulmoides has been  undertaken to test the role of spring temperature as a factor controlling the  distribution of Eucommia. Results show that the spring temperature is a limiting  factor for Eucommia seed germination and hence for the distribution pattern of  the genus. The suitable range of temperature for seed germination, established  experimentally, is from 13\textdegree C to 22\textdegree C, with an optimum of 18\textdegree C. Specimens of  fossil Eucommia cf. ulmoides, preserved as a branch segment and leaves, showing  the distinctive latex, were found in Middle Miocene sediments of Shanwang  Formation, Shandong Province, East China. If the climatic tolerances documented  here for E. ulmoides are extrapolated to Shanwang, they are in fact consistent  with other predictions of the paleoclimate at this site, indicative of the  potential value of Eucommia as a biothermometer. These Miocene fossils, and one  previously described Eocene fruit specimen, prove the former existence of  Eucommia in China in addition to North America and Europe. This confirms that the  genus is not a recent arrival in China and extends our understanding of the past  biogeography of the genus.},

  abstract = {An open microwave-assisted extraction system was used to extract gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid from Eucommia ulmodies.  The effect of extraction variables, especially solvent, on the recoveries of  these polyphenolic compounds was investigated using factorial design. As  extracting solvent for these compounds, methanol produced a higher recovery than  pure water. For straight chain alcohol solvents, the lower the carbon number, the  higher the recoveries of the polyphenolic acids. The optimal ratio of  methanol:water:glacial acetic acid in the solvent mixture used in  microwave-assisted extraction was 2:8:0.3 (v/v) and this solvent could be  directly used as the mobile phase in HPLC separation without additional  intermittent treatment as reported in literature. The extraction under the  condition of 50\% microwave power and 30 s irradiation at a solvent:sample ratio  of 10 (mL/g) was found to be the most advantageous. The repeatability test of  extraction and chromatographic analysis was satisfactory for the analysis of  these polyphenolic compounds.},

  abstract = {EAFP2 is a novel antifungal protein isolated from the bark of the tree Eucommia ulmoides Oliver. It consists of 41 residues and is characterized with a  five-disulfide motif and the inhibitory effects on the growth of both cell wall  chitin-containing and chitin-free fungi. The crystal structure of EAFP2 at an  atomic resolution of 0.84 A has been determined by using Shake-and-Bake direct  methods with the program SnB. The phases obtained were of sufficient quality to  permit the initial model built automatically and the structural refinement  carried out using anisotropic displacement parameters resulted in a final  crystallographic R factor of 6.8\%. In the resulting structural model, all  non-hydrogen protein atoms including an unusual pyroglutamyl acid residue at the  N-terminal can fit to the articulated electron densities with one centre and more  than 65\% of the hydrogen atoms in the protein can be observed as individual peaks  in the difference map. The general fold of EAFP2 is composed of a 3(10) helix  (Cys3-Arg6), an alpha-helix (Ala27-Cys31) and a three-stranded antiparallel  beta-sheet (Cys16-Ser18, Cys23-Ser25, and Cys35-Cys37) and cross-linked by five  disulfide bridges. The tertiary structure of EAFP2 can be divided into two  structural sectors, A and B. Sector A composed of residues 11-30 adopts a  conformation similar to the chitin-binding domain in the hevein-like proteins and  features a hydrophobic surface embraced a chitin-binding site (Tyr20, 22, 29, and  Ser18). The distinct disulfide bridge Cys7-Cys37 connects the N-terminal ten  residues with the C-terminal segment 35-41 to form the sector B, which features a  cationic surface distributing all four positively charged residues, Arg6, 9, 36,  and 40. Based on these structural features, the possible structural basis of the  functional properties of EAFP2 is discussed.},

The effect of PJBH extracts on H2O2-induced toxicity in the rat  pheochromocytoma line PC12 was examined by measurements of cell lesion, level of  lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities, since free radicals are  involved in neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). After a 30 min  exposure of the cells to H2O2 (150 microM), a marked decrease in cell survival,  activities of glutathione peroxidase and catalase as well as an increased  production of malondialdehyde (MDA) were found. Pretreatment of the cells with  PJBH (0.5-10 microg/ml) prior to H2O2 exposure significantly elevated cell  survival, antioxidant enzyme activities and resulted in a decrease in the level  of MDA. The effects of the PJBH on hydrogen peroxide-induced injury in PC12 cells  were also examined. PJBH had a remarkable elevating effect on catalase and GSH-Px  activities as well as cell survival, suggesting that cytoprotective effects of  the PJBH are involved in stimulation against intermediate concentrations of  H2O2-induced PC12 cell injury. The above-mentioned neuroprotective effects were  also compared with the effect of tacrine. The results suggest that PJBH has  potential for use as a novel neuronal therapeutic agent.},

EAFP2 is a newly discovered 41-residue peptide distinct with a  five-disulfide cross-linked motif. This peptide exhibits chitin-binding activity  and inhibitory effects on the growth of cell wall chitin-containing fungi and  chitin-free fungi. The structure was calculated by using torsion angle dynamic  simulated annealing with a total of 614 distance restraints and 16 dihedral  restraints derived from NOESY and DQF-COSY spectra, respectively. The five  disulfide bonds were assigned from preliminary structures using a statistical  analysis of intercystinyl distances. The solution structure of EAFP2 is presented  as an ensemble of 20 conformers with a backbone RMS deviation of 0.65 (+/-0.13) A  for the well-defined Cys3-Cys39 segment. The tertiary structure of EAFP2  represents the first five-disulfide cross-linked structural model of the plant  antifungal peptide. EAFP2 adopts a compact global fold composed of a 3(10) helix  (Cys3-Arg6), an alpha-helix (Gly26-Cys30), and a three-strand antiparallel  beta-sheet (Cys16-Ser18, Tyr22-Gly24, and Arg36-Cys37).

  abstract = {The vasorelaxant effects of the aqueous extract prepared from the bark of the Chinese medicinal herb, Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (also referred to as Tu-Chung or  Du-Zhong), which is a common active ingredient in traditional antihypertensive  herbal prescriptions in China, have recently been characterized in rat aorta and  dog carotid artery. The vasorelaxant effect of eucommia bark extract on these  large elastic arteries was found to be entirely endothelium-dependent and nitric  oxide (NO)-mediated. Since smaller muscular arteries play a more dominant role in  the change of peripheral resistance and thus the regulation of blood pressure, we  have now compared the relaxant effects of eucommia bark extract using aorta and  the proximal as well as the distal ends of the superior mesenteric arteries from  the rat, with a specific objective to investigate whether smaller muscular  arteries also elicit endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation (EDVR) in response  to eucommia bark extract. We have also determined whether the EDVR, if indeed  occurring in the mesenteric arteries, is mediated entirely by NO, or whether it  also involves endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). We found that  all three types of vessel preparations elicit EDVR in response to the eucommia  bark extract concentration-dependently in a similar manner to the relaxant  responses to carbachol (CCh). Although the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME totally  abolished the EDVR in aorta, it only partial abolished EDVR in mesenteric  arteries isolated from each end, the distal end being more resistant to L-NAME.  However, the residual L-NAME-resistant relaxation of the rat mesenteric arteries  could be further inhibited by preincubation of the vessels with the combination  of L-NAME and 15-20 mM KCl (KCl itself at this low concentration caused little or  no contraction). Therefore, the EDVR induced by the eucommia extract and CCh in  aorta is mediated entirely by NO, and that in mesenteric arteries by NO as well  as EDHF, with the EDHF component (inhibited by KCl) larger in the smaller distal  end of the rat mesenteric artery. Results of our study offer a plausible  mechanistic basis for the vasorelaxing action of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., which  may account for its well-documented antihypertensive action.},

A relatively weak retention of the target product molecule  (chlorogenic acid) on the polymer and a strong adsorption capability of the  monolith to the template and several main impurities were observed.

A cultured neonatal rat calvarias  organ was used to measure the potential of GGT-TCM composite for use in promoting  the regeneration of defective bone tissue. The mitochondria activity of the bone  cells following exposure to various concentrations of crude extracts of five  herbal Chinese medicines was measured by colorimetric assay. Biochemical markers,  such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)  titers were analyzed to evaluate the activities of bone cells. Finally, we  examined the organ culture units, which were maintained in cultured medium for 5  weeks. Morphology of tissue was observed, and the quantitative evaluation of the  regenerated bone was determined. In a bone cells culture experiment, adding  Cuscuta chinensis Lam. (TCM-5) to the bone cells culture clearly promoted the  proliferation and differentiation of the osteoblasts from their precursor cells;  but the reduced amount of TRAP indicated that the medicine significantly  inhibited the osteoclasts activities. Opposite bone cell responses were observed  when Loranthus parasiticus Merr. (TCM-3) and Achyranthes bidentata Bl. (TCM-4)  were added to the bone cells culture. Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (TCM-1) and  Dipsacus asper Wall.

Using the human skin  fibroblast HS68 cell line in the present study, we investigated the  photoprotective effects of aucubin from Eucommia ulmoides. Pretreatment with  aucubin significantly inhibited the production of MMP-1 by 57\% when compared to  the UVB-irradiated cells. Additionally, the senescence-associated  beta-galactosidase (SA beta-gal) activity was markedly decreased in the presence  of aucubin, which indicates it as an antiphoto-induced aging compound. As the  effect of aucubin was determined against ROS, the inhibited ROS formation and  malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the increased cell viability and glutathione  (GSH) level were observed with aucubin under UVB irradiation. Based upon these  results, it was suggested that aucubin might play an important role in the  cellular defense mechanism against UV radiation-induced photoaging. An  understanding of the antioxidant properties of aucubin could, in part, act to  elucidate its protective mechanism on the human skin photoaging.},

Four isolates from California and one from Europe  were also included in the study. Isolates were grouped on the basis of DNA  sequences from intron regions in the translation elongation factor 1-{$\alpha$} and  calmodulin genes. According to DNA sequence comparisons with the type isolate,  all isolates except two (OH-48 and CAL-5) were determined to be P. viticola,  confirming the etiology of this disease in the Great Lakes region. Thirty  representative isolates were evaluated for mycelial growth rate in vitro,  conidial size, and pathogenicity on grapevine (Vitis interspecific hybrid  'Seyval') leaves and internodes. A subsample of 13 isolates was also evaluated  for pathogenicity on fruit and rachises. All isolates of P. viticola caused  disease on grape but differed in virulence. Among P. viticola isolates, virulence  on leaves and internodes was positively correlated, and virulence on fruit and  rachises was positively correlated, but there was no relationship between ratings  on vegetative versus reproductive grape tissues. Some isolates that were not  virulent on leaves or internodes were highly virulent on fruit and rachises and  vice versa, indicating some specialization with respect to host tissues. However,  differences were mostly of a quantitative nature, which makes it difficult if not  impossible to assign biotypes. Among P. viticola isolates, virulence on fruit and  rachises was positively correlated with mycelial growth rate in vitro. For the  two isolates that were not P. viticola, the internal transcribed spacer regions  of the nuclear ribosomal DNA were sequenced for identification purposes. Based on  the best match available in GenBank, CAL-5 was determined to be close to  Diaporthe phaseolorum, while the sequence of OH-48 matched that of Phomopsis sp.  from Eucommia ulmoides in China. Both isolates had shorter alpha conidia and  significantly higher mycelial growth rates than the P. viticola isolates, and  were not or only slightly pathogenic to Vitis interspecific hybrid 'Seyval'.},

The Pb (25 mg/kg of body weight) was  administered orally once a week for 4 weeks, while the DzCw was administered  orally at a dosage of 0.139 g of DzCw/kg of body weight/day.

Although the blood and hepatic  delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activities were significantly lower  in the Pb group compared with the normal control group, both ALAD activities was  normalized with the administration of DzCw. The erythrocyte superoxide dismutase  and catalase activities were significantly higher in the Pb group than in the  normal control group, whereas the glutathione peroxidase activity and glutathione  level were lowered by Pb administration compared with the normal group. However,  the administration of DzCw was found to enhance the antioxidant defense system  and significantly lower lipid peroxidation levels in erythrocytes compared with  the Pb group.

ABA and IAA clearly displayed opposite annual  distribution patterns. In the active period (AP), both immunolocalization and  HPLC detected an abrupt decrease of ABA, reaching its lowest level in the summer.  During dormancy, ABA started increasing in the first quiescence (Q1) (autumn),  peaked in the rest (winter), and gradually decreased from the onset of the second  quiescence (Q2) (the end of winter). IAA showed a reverse pattern to that of ABA:  it sharply increased in AP, but noticeably decreased from the commencement of Q1.  Longitudinally, the ABA distribution increased apico-basally, contrasting with  IAA. Laterally, most of the ABA was located in mature vascular tissues, whereas  the IAA essentially occurred in the cambial region. The concomitant IAA-ABA  distribution and seasonal changes in vascular tissues greatly correlated with  xylem and phloem cell production, and late wood differentiation and maturation.  Interestingly, the application of exogenous ABA to quiescent E. ulmoides  branches, in a water-culture system, inhibited external IAA action on cambial  activity reactivation. These results suggest that, in E. ulmoides, ABA and IAA  might probably interact in the cambial region. The annual cambial activity could  be influenced by an IAA:ABA ratio; and ABA might play a key role in vascular  cambium dormancy in higher plants. The relationship between hormonal changes and  the (particular) annual life cycle of E. ulmoides is also discussed.},

  abstract = {The current study investigated whether Du-zhong (Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.) leaves could improve the hyperglycemia in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats.  Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a non-diabetic group (NDM), diabetic  group (DM), diabetic group supplemented with powdered Du-zhong leaves (DM-PDZ)  and diabetic group supplemented with a water extract of the powdered Du-zhong  leaves (DM-WDZ). Diabetes was induced by injecting STZ (70 mg/kg B.W., i.p.). The  powdered Du-zhong leaves or its powdered water extract was add to a standard diet  based on 1\% dried Du-zhong leaves (1 g PDZ/100 g diet and 0.187 g WDZ/100 g diet,  respectively) for 3 weeks. Body weight was significantly higher in both types of  Du-zhong leaves supplemented groups than in the DM group. The blood glucose  levels were significantly lower in the DM-PDZ and DM-WDZ groups than in the DM  group (20.05+/-0.88 and 18.96+/-1.23 mmol/l versus 24.42+/-1.07 mmol/l, P{$<$}0.05),  whereas the plasma insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly higher in the  PDZ and WDZ supplemented groups than in the DM group (7.45+/-0.27 and 7.62+/-0.69  microl U/ml versus 3.75+/-0.27 microl U/ml for the plasma insulin, and  224.52+/-14.6 and 239.76+/-15.52 pmol/l versus 166.5+/-10.4 pmol/l for the plasma  C-peptide, respectively, P{$<$}0.05). The supplementation of PDZ and WDZ also  resulted in lower plasma urea nitrogen levels compared to the DM group. Du-zhong  leaves supplement seemed to be helpful to preserve the normal histological  appearance of pancreatic islets as well as to preserve insulin-positive  beta-cells but it did not reverse the effect of STZ to a great extent.  Accordingly, the reduction in plasma glucose by the powdered Du-zhong leaves and  its water extract is quite small but significant, nevertheless, this was occurred  with simultaneous the increase in plasma insulin and C-peptide. They improved  hyperglycemia and seemingly enhance the function of pancreatic beta-cells in  STZ-induced diabetic rats.},

The activities of  erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  peroxidase (GSH-Px) were significantly higher in the Du-zhong group compared with  the control group, while glutathione reductase (GR) activity was not different  between groups. The activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and GR in liver and kidney were  not affected by Du-zhong extract supplementation, whereas the CAT activity was  significantly higher in the Du-zhong group than in the control group. Du-zhong  extract supplementation resulted in lower levels of hydrogen peroxide and lipid  peroxide in erythrocytes, liver, and kidney.

In the cambial region, ABP1 expression at both  the protein and the mRNA level was found to be high, low, and remarkably scarce  in the active, quiescent, and resting stages, respectively, during cambium  periodicity. The signal abundance of ABP1 follows the opposite pattern to ABA  accumulation and correlates with auxin responsiveness of the cambial tissues,  suggesting a role for ABP1 in mediating auxin-dependent regulation of cambial  activation in the activity-dormancy cycle. This paper attempts to explain why IAA  would 'boost' the reactivation of a quiescent cambium, and not that of a resting  cambium. Results also show that ABP1 expression is improved by IAA, while  inhibited by ABA.},

A full-length cDNA encoding HMGR (designated  as EuHMGR, GenBank Accession No. AY796343) was isolated from Eucommia ulmoides by  rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of EuHMGR comprises  2281 bp with a 1770-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 590-amino-acid  polypeptide with two trans-membrane domains revealed by bioinformatic analysis.  Molecular modeling showed that EuHMGR is a new HMGR with a spatial structure  similar to other plant HMGRs. The deduced protein has an isoelectric point (pI)  of 6.89 and a calculated molecular weight of about 63 kDa. Sequence comparison  analysis showed that EuHMGR had highest homology to HMGR from Hevea brasiliensis.  As expected, phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that EuHMGR belongs to plant  HMGR group. Tissue expression pattern analysis showed that EuHMGR is strongly  expressed in the leaves and stems whereas it is only poorly expressed in the  roots, which implies that EuHMGR may be a constitutively expressing gene.  Functional complementation of EuHMGR in HMGR-deficient mutant yeast JRY2394  demonstrated that EuHMGR mediates the mevalonate biosynthesis in yeast.},

The expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in penile tissues was  examined by two steps immunohistochemistry method. RESULTS: Compared with group  A, catching frequency of the rats in group C was notably increased (P {$<$} 0.05) and  the expression of nNOS in penile tissue was significantly (P {$<$} 0.001). The  examination by transmission electron microscope showed that in the rats' penile  tissue of group A, myelinated nerve fibers were irregularly arranged and  partially degenerated, and myelin sheaths lamella were splited and exhibited  vacuoles or network forms. In group C, there were regular arrangements of  myelinated nerve fibers, in which the formation of lamella was clear.

The hepatic glucokinase activity was  significantly higher in the WDZ group, whereas, the glucose-6-phosphatase and  phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities were significantly lower. The WDZ  supplementation also significantly lowered the hepatic fatty acid synthase,  HMG-CoA reductase and ACAT activities compared to the control group, while it  elevated the lipoprotein lipase activity in the skeletal muscle. The WDZ also  altered the plasma and hepatic lipid levels by lowering the cholesterol and  triglyceride concentrations, while elevating the plasma HDL-cholesterol level.

The aim of this study was to identify the preferred route of penetration of LA and to localize the molecule, using a microautoradiographic technique associated with a compartmental approach. In an in vitro test using topical application of 0.05 g of a formulation containing 1\% of LA, 10\% of the total recovery was found in the stratum corneum and dermis after 6 h. Microautoradiographic analysis of a 'virtual' slide showed most of the silver grains, i.e. LA, at the hair sheath, and none in the dermal compartment, confirming the diffusion of LA through a preferred transfollicular route. These results show, for the first time on human scalp skin, that the combination of compartmental analysis and microautoradiography points to a preferred transfollicular route of diffusion of topically applied LA. Thanks to its high-resolution, microautoradiography offers the advantage of providing detailed in situ information on the delivery of LA in the skin, including the cellular location of the molecule.},

Soil water varied significantly in its vertical distribution,  and the variation pattern also differed with seasons. The vertical distribution  of soil water could be divided into two phases, i.e., accumulation and depletion  based on the seasonal variation of soil water, or rainy season and dry season  based on the monthly variation of rainfall. Soil water was correlated  significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) with relative humidity (RH), air temperature (t), vapor  pressure deficit (VPD) and rainfall (R), and regulated by these meteorological  factors synthetically, among which, rainfall was the most important factor,  followed by air temperature. The soil water loss rate after rain had a  significant hyperbolic relationship with durative droughty days, while soil water  storage had a significant linear negative relationship with this duration (P {$<$}  0.05). With the extension of drought duration after rain, soil water loss tended  to vary gently with increasing soil depth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plants containing compounds such as the isoflavonoids, with female hormone-like effects that bind to human estrogen receptors, are known. But none  has been previously shown to have corresponding male hormone-like effects that  interact with the human androgen receptor. Here, we report that the tree bark  (cortex) of the Gutta-Percha tree Eucommia ulmoides possesses bimodal  phytoandrogenic and hormone potentiating effects by lipidic components. METHODS:  The extracts of E. ulmoides were tested using in-vitro reporter gene bioassays  and in-vivo animal studies. Key compounds responsible for the steroidogenic  effects were isolated and identified using solid phase extraction (SPE), high  performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC), gas  chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS), electron spray ionisation-mass  spectroscopy (ESI-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). RESULTS: The  following bioactivities of E. ulmoides were found: (1) a phenomenal tripartite  synergism exists between the sex steroid receptors (androgen and estrogen  receptors), their cognate steroidal ligands and lipidic augmenters isolated from  E. ulmoides, (2) phytoandrogenic activity of E. ulmoides was mediated by plant  triterpenoids binding cognately to the androgen receptor (AR) ligand binding  domain. CONCLUSION: In addition to well-known phytoestrogens, the existence of  phytoandrogens is reported in this study. Furthermore, a form of tripartite  synergism between sex steroid receptors, sex hormones and plant-derived lipids is  described for the first time. This could have contrasting clinical applications  for hypogonadal- and hyperlipidaemic-related disorders.},

Since our previous study has been shown to have the  anti-inflammatory activity of CML-1 in vivo and the upregulation of adhesion  molecules in response to numerous inducing factors is associated with  inflammation, this study examined the effect of CML-1 on the expression of  adhesion molecules induced by TNF-alpha in cultured human umbilical vein  endothelial cells (HUVECs). Preincubation of HUVECs for 20h with CML-1  (1-100mug/ml) dose-dependently inhibited TNF-alpha (10ng/ml)-induced adhesion of  THP-1 monocytic cells, as well as mRNA and protein expression of E-selectin,  vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1  (ICAM-1). CML-1 was also shown to inhibit NK-kB activation induced by TNF-alpha.  Furthermore, CML-1 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced IkB kinase activation, subsequent  degradation of IkBalpha, and nuclear translocation of NK-kB. Evidence presented  in this report demonstrated that CML-1 inhibited the adhesive capacity of HUVEC  and the TNF-alpha-mediated induction of E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in HUVEC by  inhibiting the IkB/NF-kB signaling pathway at the level of IkB kinase, which may  explain the ability of CML-1 to suppress inflammation and modulate the immune  response.},

In this paper, we describe the Fourier transform near  infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) technique coupled with a partial least squares  (PLS) regression model to quantify natural polyisoprene in Eucommia ulmoides  leaves. PLS regression models are discussed with respect to linearity,  root-mean-square error of estimation (RMSEE), and root-mean-square error of  prediction (RMSEP). The best PLS regression model was obtained with second  derivative NIR spectra in the region between 4000-6000 cm(-1) (R2Y, 0.95; RMSEE,  0.25; RMSEP, 0.37).

  abstract = {The vascular effects of an aqueous extract prepared from the leaves of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (ELE), a medicinal herb commonly used in antihypertensive herbal  prescriptions in China, were investigated in rat mesenteric resistance arteries.  The mesenteric vascular bed was perfused with Krebs solution and the perfusion  pressure was measured with a pressure transducer. In preparations with an intact  endothelium and precontracted with 7 microM methoxamine, perfusion of ELE (107102  mg/ml for 15 min) caused a concentration-dependent vasodilatation, which was  abolished by chemical removal of the endothelium. The ELE-induced vasodilatation  was inhibited by neither indomethacin (INDO, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) nor  NG-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME, a nitric oxide inhibitor). The  ELE-induced vasodilatation was significantly inhibited by tetraethylammonium  (TEA, a K channel blocker) and 18alpha-glycyrrhetinic acid (18alpha-GA, a  gap-junction inhibitor), and abolished by high K-containing Krebs' solution.  Atropine (a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist) significantly inhibited  the vasodilatation induced by ELE at high concentrations. These results suggest  that the ELE-induced vasodilatation is endothelium-dependent but nitric oxide  (NO)- and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2)-independent, and is mainly mediated by the  endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) in the mesenteric resistance  arteries. Furthermore, the ELE-induced EDHF-mediated response involves the  activation of K-channels and gap junctions.},

  abstract = {This paper exploited a novel method of single solvent recycling plus enzymatic pretreatment. Petroleum ether (60-90 degrees C) was an ideal solvent to extract  Eucommia gum at high temperature (approximately 80 degrees C) and to precipitate  the gum (flocculent) as the temperature of the solution fell to below 40 degrees  C. The gutta percha was almost completely precipitated from solution as the  temperature cooled down to below 0 degree C. After filtration and recovery of the  precipitated gum, the filtrate, petroleum ether, was applied to an activated  carbon column to remove dissolved impurities and reused for next gutta percha  extraction. Because impurities were kept in solution, the precipitated gutta  percha was highly pure. In an experiment of enzyme hydrolyzing the plant cell  wall, cuticle layers on the surfaces of leaves prevented cellulase from  approaching to and hydrolyzing the cellulose of the cell wall. NaOH (1\%) at 70  degrees C efficiently degraded the cuticle layer, which greatly improved the  enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose within eucommia leaves. Gutta percha that was  extracted from the alkali- and cellulase-treated leaves had a degree of  polymerization as high as in the leaves, and the yield increased from 2.5\% of  milled leaves up to over 3.2\%. The tensile strength of obtained gutta percha  increased from 0.02 MPa of milled Eucommia leaves to 60.5 MPa, the breakage  extensibility ranged from about 0 to 24\%, and the tearing strength ranged from  0.5 to 36 kN/m.},

Various  numbers of endophytic fungi (5-8 taxa) were obtained from each plant. Alternaria  alternata was the dominant species in the 6 plants, and Microsphaeropsis  conielloides was also dominant in Eucommia ulmoides. There were high colonization  rates (47.9\%-63.1\%) and isolation rates (0.7-0.93) of endophytic fungi, and they  were conspicuously higher in twigs than those in leaves in the 6 plants examined.  The colonization and isolation rates of endophytic fungi increased with the twig  age. The results based on the analyses of cluster and Sorenson's similarity  coefficients indicated that some endophytic fungi showed a certain degree of host  and tissue preference.},

In both two soil layers under VI,  the contents of B, Mo, Cu and Mn were the lowest. Mn had the biggest single  element available index, while Cu had the smallest one. The biggest and smallest  total available index of soil microelements was 12.28 for VII and 2.95 for VI,  respectively.

A  good linear relationship was observed between soil organic matter and B and Zn  availabilities, and the relationship of soil organic matter with available Mn  could be described by a quadratic equation. Soil pH was highly positively  correlated with soil Cu and Zn contents, correlated with soil Mo and Mn contents,  slightly correlated with soil B content, and slightly negatively correlated with  soil Fe content.},

Here it is shown that new sieve elements (SEs)  appeared in the regenerated tissues before the formation of wound cambium during  bark regeneration after girdling, and they could originate from the  transdifferentiation of immature/differentiating axial xylem cells left on the  trunk. Assays of water-cultured twigs revealed that girdling blocked sucrose  transport until the formation of new SEs, and the regeneration of the functional  SEs was not dependent on the substance provided by the axis system outside the  girdled areas, while exogenous indole acetic acid (IAA) applied on the wound  surface accelerated SE differentiation. The experiments suggest that the immature  xylem cells can transdifferentiate into phloem cells under certain conditions,  which means xylem and phloem cells might share some identical features at the  beginning of their differentiation pathway. This study also showed that the bark  regeneration system could provide a novel method for studying xylem and phloem  cell differentiation.},

Hamsters fed  with Du-zhong leaf extract for 10 weeks showed a smaller size of epididymal  adipocytes compared to the control group.

We argue that evaluating the error rates of peptide identifications is not unlike computing generating functions in combinatorics. We show that the generating functions and their derivatives ( spectral energy and spectral probability) represent new features of tandem mass spectra that, similarly to Delta-scores, significantly improve peptide identifications. Furthermore, the spectral probability provides a rigorous solution to the problem of computing statistical significance of spectral identifications. The spectral energy/probability approach improves the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff of existing MS/MS search tools, addresses the notoriously difficult problem of "one-hit-wonders" in mass spectrometry, and often eliminates the need for decoy database searches. We therefore argue that the generating function approach has the potential to increase the number of peptide identifications in MS/MS searches.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Eucommia ulmoides leaf (EUL) supplementation on the growth performance, blood and meat quality  parameters in growing and finishing pigs. Ninety gilts (L x LW x D, 20 kg  initialBW) were housed 10 per pen in a front-open building with three replicate  pens per treatment. Experimental treatment was started from the beginning of the  growing stage (20 +/- 3 kg) by supplementing EUL at 0(C), 3(T1) and 5\% (T2) to  the growing and finishing diet. Pigs were slaughtered by electrical stunning at  105 +/- 3 kg live weight. Average daily feed intake (ADFI, kg/day) decreased (P {$<$}  0.05) by addition of EUL in growth performance, average daily gain (ADG, kg/day)  was lower (P {$<$} 0.05) in T1 and T2 than in C. In hematology, leukocytes (WBC,  10(3)/mm(3)) decreased (P {$<$} 0.05) in T1 and T2 than in C. Erythrocytes (RBC,  10(6)/mm(3)), hemoglobin (HGB, g/dL) and hematocrit (HCT, \%) increased (P {$<$} 0.05)  in T1 and T2 than in C. Platelet (PLT, 10(3)/mm(3)) was lower (P {$<$} 0.05) in T2  than in C and T1. In biochemical composition of serum, total protein (g/dL),  r-GTP (micro/L), total cholesterol (mg/dL) and triglycerides (mg/dL) were lower  (P {$<$} 0.05) in T1 and T2 than in C. On longissimus dorsi muscle, crude protein was  higher (P {$<$} 0.05) in T1 than in C. Crude ash was higher (P {$<$} 0.05) in T1 and T2  than in C. Yellow to blue color scale (CIE b*) in meat color was higher (P {$<$}  0.05) in T2 than in C. CIE b* in back fat color was higher (P {$<$} 0.05) in T2 than  in the other treatments. In sensory evaluation scores for fresh meat, the values  of meat color, fat color, drip loss and marbling were not significantly affected  by addition of EUL. In cooked meat, the values of chewiness and overall  acceptability were higher (P {$<$} 0.05) in T1 and T2 than in C. The results indicate  that the addition of EUL affected growth performance, blood parameters and meat  quality parameters in growing and finishing pigs.},

By HPLC-MS analysis, the main phenolic compounds  (geniposidic acid, epicatechin, and chlorogenic acid) identified in EWEDL and  EEDL were similar. EWEDL and EEDL had total phenolic contents of 13.84 +/- 0.11  and 14.72 +/- 0.14 mg chlorogenic acid equivalents (CAE) in each gram of extract,  respectively.

(EUO) bark and leaf against cytotoxicity induced by  amyloid-{$\beta$} peptide (A{$\beta$}) and to explore their active components. The PC-12 cells  injury mediated by A{$\beta$}(25-35) was employed to assess the neuroprotective effects  of EUO bark, EUO leaf and various compounds. Intracellular Ca(2+) determination,  MTT reduction assay, lactate dehydrogenase leakage evaluation and HO33258/PI  staining were used to quantitatively or qualitatively evaluate cell viability and  injury. The organic solvents partition and the macroporous resin separation were  also applied to tracing the active constituents of EUO bark. Moreover, the  effects of 8 compounds (3 iridoid glucoside, 3 phenylpripanoids and 2 flavonoids)  were tested to identify the active compounds of EUO leaf. The results  demonstrated that the water extracts of EUO barks and leaves, geniposidic acid  and chlorogenic acid could efficiently protect PC-12 cells against the  cytotoxicity of A{$\beta$}(25-35). This research suggests that EUO may represent a  potential treatment strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, geniposidic acid  and chlorogenic acid are the major active constituents of EUO barks and leaves,  respectively.},

Water extracts of both herbal  materials were tested in vitro with a battery of assay models:  lipopolysaccharide-induced thromboxane B(2) for cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1),  prostaglandin E(2) for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the translocation of nuclear  factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and nitric  oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 cells. The contents of the iridoid glycosides,  aucubin (AU), catalpol (CA), and geniposide (GE), were quantified by  high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Neither E. ulmoides nor P.  asiatica suppressed the COX-1 enzyme. P. asiatica significantly inhibited COX-2  (concentration required for 50\% inhibition [IC(50)] = 8.61 (microg/mL), TNFalpha  (IC(50) = 9.63 (microg/mL), and NO (IC(50) = 8.65 (microg/mL) production. P.  asiatica blocked the translocation of NF-kappaB from the cytosol to the nucleus.  E. ulmoides suppressed only the COX-2 enzyme (IC(50) = 9.92 (microg/mL). The  results of the HPLC analysis revealed that P. asiatica contained three iridoid  glycosides, AU, CA, and GE. E. ulmoides contained CA and GE, but no AU was  detected. The difference in the anti-inflammatory potencies of E. ulmoides and P.  asiatica appears to be dependent on the presence of AU. Considering the IC(50)  values, both herbal extracts exhibit modest and less potent anti-inflammatory  activities than common synthetic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.},

Dot blotting was  performed between the polyclonal antibody of control antigen and the aqueous  extracts of nine Chinese traditional medicines on a piece of PVDF membrane, and  the blotting signals were analyzed by the software of Quantity One. RESULT:  Blotting signals with hot control antigen of nine Chinese traditional medicines  in descending were Zingiber officinale, Aconitum carmichaeli, Eucommia ulmoides,  Fraxinus rhynchophylla, Lonicera japonica, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, Coptis  chinensis, Rheum palmatum and Phellodendron chinense, which degree of similarity  to control antigen in peak value were 57.33\%, 43.56 \%, 34.16\%, 30.2\%, 28.81\%,  26.53\%, 21.68\%, 17.62\% and 14.85\%, respectively.

The co-solvent composition was tested and  extraction conditions were optimized. Results showed that the best co-solvent was  a water-ethanol mixture (1 + 3, v/v), and the highest yield was obtained when the  extraction was performed under 26 MPa at extraction and separation temperatures  of 55 and 30 degrees C for 120 min, using 6 mL co-solvent/g material at a CO2  flow rate of 20 L/h. In a comparison of the supercritical CO2 and Soxhlet  extraction methods, the Soxhlet method needed 3 h to extract 10 g material,  whereas the supercritical CO2 extraction technique needed only 2 h to extract 100  g material, thus showing a high extraction capability. The supercritical CO2  extraction produced a higher yield, with a lower cost for the extraction. Owing  to the advantages of low extraction temperature, high yield, and ease of  separating the product from the solvent, supercritical CO2 extraction is likely  to be developed into an ideal technique for the extraction of aucubin, a compound  with thermal instability, from the seeds of this plant.},

In this study, we  employed pNF-kappaB-Luc or pIFN-gamma-Luc and BALB/c mice peritoneal macrophages  or splenocytes to investigate both the immune and inflammatory effects of six  selected plant species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specifically, we used ethyl  acetate fractions of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bunge var. mongholicus  (Bunge) Hsiao (Fabaceae) (AM), Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees  (Acanthaceae) (AP), Angelica sinensis (Oliv.) Diels (Apiaceae) (AS), Eucommia  ulmodes Oliv. (Eucommiaceae) leaves (EU leaves), Isatis indigotica Fort.  (Brassicaceae) (II) and Morus alba L. (Moraceae) (MA). RESULTS: We found that  ethyl acetate fractions of AP, AS and MA significantly decreased NF-kappaB  luciferase activity and also the secretion of NO and PGE(2) in LPS/IFN-gamma  stimulated mouse peritoneal macrophages (p{$<$}0.05). In contrast, they did not  affect IFN-gamma luciferase activity or IFN-gamma production in concanavalin A  (Con A)-activated mouse splenocytes. Our results indicated that the  anti-inflammatory properties of these plant extracts might be resulted from the  inhibition of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., NO and PGE(2)), at least in part  via suppression of a signaling pathway such as NF-kappaB. CONCLUSIONS:  Collectively, we have found that three potent bioactive TCMH species exerted  significant NF-kappaB inhibitory activity and acted in a cell type dependent  fashion.},

In the present  study, we examined whether Du-Zhong cortex extract (DZCE) with graded doses  exerted its preventive effects on estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis.  Eighty 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were used and randomly assigned  into sham-operated group (Sham) and five ovariectomy (OVX) subgroups, i.e. OVX  with vehicle (OVX); OVX with 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (E(2), 25 microg/kg/day);  OVX with DZCE of graded doses (100, 300, or 500 mg/kg/day). Daily oral  administration of DZCE or E(2) started on week 4 after OVX for 16 weeks.  Treatment with DZCE at higher doses (300 or 500 mg/kg/day) was found to be able  to significantly prevent OVX-induced decrease in biomechanical quality of femur  such as maximum stress and Young's modulus. The mechanical changes were  associated with the prevention of a further bone mineral density (BMD) decrease  or even with some improvements in microarchitecture. DZCE dose-dependently  inhibited total BMD decrease in the femur caused by OVX, which was accompanied by  a significant decrease in skeletal remodeling, as was evidenced by the decreased  levels of the bone turnover markers osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatese (ALP),  deoxypyridinoline (DPD), and urinary Ca and P excretions. muCT analysis of the  femoral metaphysis showed that DZCE at the highest doses (500 mg/kg/day)  significantly prevents decrease in bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), connect  density (Conn.D), trabecula number (Tb.N) and trabecula thickness (Tb.Th), and  increase in trabecula separation (Tb.Sp) and structure model index (SMI) in OVX  rats. We conclude that 16 weeks of DZCE treatment improves bone biomechanical  quality through modifications of BMD, and trabecular microarchitecture without  hyperplastic effect on uterus, and it might be a potential alternative medicine  for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.},

METHOD:  Forty-one samples of E. unloads were collected from three different producing  areas and their main component, namely pinoresinol diglucoside, was determined by  HPLC. Corresponding data of samples were collected from 12 000 to 4 000 cm(-1) by  near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy. The spectral pretreatment was optimized  by OPUS software and the calibration equations between the content of pinoresinol  diglucoside and spectrum data were constructed by partial least squares  regression. RESULT: Available information could be extracted from spectra in the  range from 7 502 to 4 597.6 cm(-1) after corrected by applying second derivative  transformation and subtract a linear correction. Cross validation was used to  prevent over-fitting. Good correlation existed between pinoresinol diglucoside  content and NIR spectra ( R2 = 0.926 4, SEC = 0.029 and SEP = 0.066 2).  CONCLUSION: NIRS calibration equations developed in this study could be applied  to the rapid analysis of the pinoresinol diglucoside content.},

One hundred and  thirty erosive rainfall events generating runoff in plots were grouped into four  rainfall types by means of K-mean clustering method. Erosive rainfall type I is  the dominant rainfall type. The amount of runoff and the soil loss under erosive  rainfall type III were the most, followed by rain-fall type II, IV and I.  Compared with CSF treatment, reforestation treatments decreased the average  annual runoff depth and the soil loss by 25.5\%-61.8\% and 93.9\%-96.2\% during the  study period respectively. Meanwhile, runoff depth at PSF and EEF treatments was  significantly lower than that in NST treatment, but no significant difference  existed in soil erosion modulus among the three reforestation treatments. This is  mainly due to the improved vegetation properties (i.e., vegetation coverage,  biomass of above- and below-ground and litter-fall mass) and soil properties  (i.e., bulk density, total porosity, infiltration rate and organic carbon  content) in the three reforestation treatments compared to CSF treatment. The PSF  and EEF are recommended as the preferred reforestation types to control runoff  and soil erosion in the red soil region of southern China, with the NST  potentially being used as an important supplement.},

  abstract = {Eucommia bark (Eucommia ulmoides Oliver) has been used as an herbal medicine, and more recently, the plant's leaves have been widely used to prepare tea which may  have anti-obesity properties. We used a metabolic syndrome-like rat model,  produced by feeding a 35\% high-fat diet (HFD), to examine potential anti-obesity  and anti-metabolic syndrome effects and mechanisms of chronic administration of  Eucommia leaf as an extract or green leaf powder. Eighty rats were studied for 3  months in ten groups. Both forms of Eucommia leaves minimised increases in body  weight and visceral fat in a dose-dependent fashion. Increases in plasma levels  of TAG and NEFA, and insulin resistance secondary to HFD were lessened by both  forms of Eucommia leaf. Concomitantly, an increase in plasma adiponectin levels  and suppression of plasma resistin and TNF-{$\alpha$} levels were confirmed. Real-time PCR  studies showed that both forms of Eucommia leaf enhanced metabolic function  across several organs, including diminishing ATP production (white adipose  tissue), accelerating {$\beta$}-oxidation (liver) and increasing the use of ketone  bodies/glucose (skeletal muscle), all of which may exert anti-obesity effects  under HFD conditions. These findings suggest that chronic administration of  either form of Eucommia leaves stimulates the metabolic function in rats across  several organs. The anti-obesity and anti-metabolic syndrome activity in this rat  model may be maintained through secretion and regulation of adipocytokines that  depend on the accumulation of visceral fat to improve insulin resistance or  hyperlipaemia.},

We examined this hypothesis, and found  that intraduodenal (ID) injection of ELE elevated epididymal white adipose tissue  sympathetic nerve activity (WAT-SNA) and interscapular brown adipose tissue  sympathetic nerve activity (BAT-SNA) in urethane-anesthetized rats and elevated  the plasma concentration of free fatty acids (FFA) (a marker of lipolysis) and  body temperature (BT) (a marker of thermogenesis) in conscious rats. Furthermore,  it was observed that ID administration of ELE decreased gastric vagal nerve  activity (GVNA) in urethane-anesthetized rats, and that ELE given as food reduced  food intake, body and abdominal adipose tissue weights and decreased plasma  triglyceride level. These findings suggest that ELE stimulates lipolysis and  thermogenesis through elevations in WAT-SNA and BAT-SNA, respectively, suppresses  appetite by inhibiting the activities of the parasympathetic nerves innervating  the gastrointestinal tract, including GVNA, and decreases the amount of abdominal  fat and body weight via these changes.},

Du-zhong leaf  extract was found to have the highest TPC content (94.46 +/- 1.17 mg of gallic  acid equiv/g of solid extract) and TFC content (61.36 +/- 0.59 mg of catechin  equiv/g of solid extract). In the above three antioxidant assay systems, Du-zhong  leaf extract also exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacities, followed by  roasted cortex extract and seed extract. The effects of Du-zhong extracts (leaf,  roasted cortex, and seed) on lipid oxidation, meat color, and metmyoglobin  (MetMb) formation in raw pork patties were investigated and compared with that of  butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) during refrigerated storage at 4 degrees C for 8  days. The results indicated that the addition of leaf extract at 0.1\% (w/w),  roasted cortex extract at 0.1\% (w/w), and BHT at 0.01\% (w/w) decreased day 8  TBARS values by 35, 20, and 37\%, respectively.

  abstract = {Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a severe and life-threatening complication of long-standing diabetes. As one of the main causes of end-stage renal disease, the  prevention and treatment of DN in early stage, and the slowing down of DN  progression are of utmost importance and are topics of several ongoing research  studies. Nutraceuticals endowed with antioxidant-anti-inflammatory properties may  offer an opportunity of integrative treatment for this condition. Male Wistar  rats were randomly assigned to two groups. One group of rats (diabetic group)  received a single tail-vein injection of STZ compound (50 mg/kg) under light  anaesthesia. A protective dose of 0.5 ml of 5 percent dextrose was given  intraperitoneally 30 min before the administration of STZ. One diabetic group was  fed a normal pellet diet (group A) while group B was fed the diet added with DTS  (panax pseudoginseng, eucommia ulmoides), (Kyotsu Jigyo, Tokyo, Japan) in the  proportion of 50/25 (percent weight/weight), at the dose of 50 mg/kg/day  throughout the experimental period. At the end of 8 weeks, 24-hour urine was  collected for the measurement of the albumin concentration: blood samples were  collected for serum biochemistry and the rats were sacrificed for kidney  measurement of oxidative stress and histomorphological features. Nephrin and  Macrophage Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) gene expression were also assessed  by fluorescence real-time quantitative PCR after RNA extraction and cDNA  synthesis. STZ-treated animals showed significantly increased in lipid  peroxidation in the kidney and in proteinuria. DTS supplementation did not affect  plasma glucose but significantly decreased malonyldialdehyde (MDA) plasma level  and the overall redox parameters together with a partial mitigation of  proteinuria. Histological analysis showed also that DTS significantly reduced the  glomerular volume together with glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis  score (p less than 0.05), the latter two being correlated to proteinuria (p less  than 0.05). DTS supplementation also enabled a reduction of diabetes-induced  decrease of nephrin mRNA expression and a 67 percent reduction of MCP-1 mRNA  up-regulation (p less than 0.01). Taken altogether, these data show that, besides  the mandatory control of glycemia, intervention with a nutraceutical with  antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties may have beneficial effects when  integrated in the mainstream of the therapeutic regimen.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vivo study, Eucommia ulmoides lignans (EuL) and  Eucommia ulmoides iridoids (EuI) were administrated to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats  and SHRs, and their blood pressures were measured. Plasma level of nitric oxide  (NO) was measured by colorimetric method, and renin activity (RA) and plasma  concentration of angiotensin II (Ang II) were measured by radioimmunoassay. In  vitro study, rat mesenteric artery was treated with EuL and the vessel relaxation  responses were determined. RESULTS: EuL could lower blood pressures of both SD  rats and SHR dose-dependently by either intravenous (i.v.) or intragastric (i.g.)  administration, but EuI failed to affect blood pressure in the two kinds of rats.  Meanwhile, no synergistic effect was observed with the combination of EuL and  EuI. The plasma level of NO in SHR treated with EuL 300 mg/kg twice a day was  markedly increased. Both plasma RA and Ang II level were decreased with long-term  oral treatment of EuL 150 and 300 mg/kg twice a day. In perfusion experiment, EuL  relaxed mesenteric artery quickly and dose-dependently and the effect on the  artery with and without endothelium was the same. CONCLUSIONS: EuL may be the  effective fraction to lowering blood pressure and its antihypertensive effect is  probably associated with regulating NO and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and  directly relaxing artery.},

This study was designed to investigate  whether long-term administration of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves extract (ELE)  ameliorates pre-diabetic state of insulin resistance and abnormal perivascular  innervation in the hyperinsulinemic state. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELE at doses of  500 and 1000mg/kg was administered orally once daily for 4 weeks in  fructose-drinking rats (FDRs). Plasma levels of insulin, blood glucose levels,  and perivascular innervation were assessed using biochemical and  immunohistochemical methods. RESULTS: FDR showed significant increase in plasma  levels of insulin, an index for insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment  ratio-HOMA-IR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP), but not blood glucose levels,  as compared with control rats. Immunohistochemical study showed significantly  greater density of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-like immunoreactivity  (LI)-containing nerves and significantly lower density of calcitonin gene-related  peptide (CGRP)-LI-containing nerves in mesenteric arteries of FDR than those in  control. A 4-week treatment with ELE (500 and 1000mg/kg, p.o.) significantly  decreased plasma levels of insulin and HOMA-IR without affecting blood glucose  levels and significantly lowered SBP in FDR. ELE treatment in FDR resulted in  significant increase in CGRP-LI never fiber density and significant decrease in  TH-LI never fiber density in mesenteric arteries of FDR. CONCLUSIONS: These  results suggest that long-term ELE treatment effectively prevents insulin  resistance development and ameliorates abnormal perivascular innervation in FDR.},

Primary screening was done by antibacterial  and antifungal reactions, and the strain reselection was done with  high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to identify the fermentation  products of the selected strains. Extracts of the leaf and cortex of Eucommia  ulmoides Oliver were also deteted by HPLC, then positive results of HPLC were  analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. In this study, 29 strains were isolated from  Eucommia ulmoides Oliver. Most of them had antibacterial activity, and a few of  them had antifungal activity. One ingredient of the B5 extract had a retention  time identical to that of authentic chlorogenic acid. With GC-MS, other  ingredients, isocoumarin and p-chlorocinnamide, were found. With LC-MS,  chlorogenic acid and geniposide related to Eucommia ulmoides Oliver were found.  The strain B5 was identified as Sordariomycete sp. Thus, endophytic fungi may  produce the bioactive compound chlorogenic acid, as their host plant does, and  could be used for the production of chlorogenic acid by fermentation in the  future.},

  abstract = {Natural polyisoprene is a biopolymer consisting of isoprene units (C(5)H(8)) that is used commercially in household, medical, and industrial materials. For the  management of natural polyisoprene production, the selection of high-yield  polyisoprene-producing trees, and an understanding of polyisoprene biosynthesis,  a high-throughput and highly sensitive screening method for the quantification of  polyisoprene is required. In this study, we examined pyrolysates from  polyisoprenes, polyprenols, carotenoids, ubiquinone (CoQ-10), and sterols by  pyrolysis gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (PyGC/MS) and determined that the  amounts of isoprene and limonene released from polyprenols and polyisoprenes were  dependent upon their molecular weights. Based on these results, we developed a  relative quantification method for polyisoprene in leaves by direct analysis of 1  mg of leaves using PyGC/MS. This novel quantification method eliminated  extraction steps and can be used in the measurement of polyisoprene contents in  Eucommia ulmoides and Hevea brasiliensis.},

The database contains 605 electron-ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS), 137 fast atom bombardment MS and 9276 electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS(n) data of 2337 authentic compounds of metabolites, 11 545 EI-MS and 834 other-MS data of 10,286 volatile natural and synthetic compounds, and 3045 ESI-MS(2) data of 679 synthetic drugs contributed by 16 research groups (January 2010). ESI-MS(2) data were analyzed under nonstandardized, independent experimental conditions. MassBank is a distributed database. Each research group provides data from its own MassBank data servers distributed on the Internet. MassBank users can access either all of the MassBank data or a subset of the data by specifying one or more experimental conditions. In a spectral search to retrieve mass spectra similar to a query mass spectrum, the similarity score is calculated by a weighted cosine correlation in which weighting exponents on peak intensity and the mass-to-charge ratio are optimized to the ESI-MS(2) data. MassBank also provides a merged spectrum for each compound prepared by merging the analyzed ESI-MS(2) data on an identical compound under different collision-induced dissociation conditions. Data merging has significantly improved the precision of the identification of a chemical compound by 21-23\% at a similarity score of 0.6. Thus, MassBank is useful for the identification of chemical compounds and the publication of experimental data.},

METHODS: The HMGR conserved fragment in A. orientale was  amplified by RT-PCR strategy with the total RNA of young leaves as the template.  HMGR mRNA expression in different organs was detected by real-time quantitative  PCR (QRT-PCR). RESULTS: The conserved fragment was 458 bp (accession NO.  HQ913638). NCBI Blast sequence analysis showed the resulting protein had high  homology to HMGR with 86.8\% similarity to Artemisia annua, 88.2\% to Bupleurum  chinense, 88.2\% to Eucommia ulmoides, and 85.5\% to Salvia miltiorrhiza. The  result of QRT-PCR showed that the HMGR gene was expressed in different organs (i.  e. leaves, petioles, tubers, and roots) which was higher in leaves relative to  other tissues. CONCLUSION: The HMGR gene conserved fragment from A. orientale was  cloned and its distribution pattern was detected for the first time. This work  provides a foundation for exploring the synthetic pathway and bioengineering of  Alisma terpenes.},

Eucommia is an herbal medicine that, by increasing nitric oxide,  reduced blood pressure (BP) in rats and humans in an uncontrolled clinical trial.  OBJECTIVE: A controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate an aqueous bark  extract of Eucommia standardized to eight percent pinoresinol di-beta-D-glucoside  (PG) for BP reduction in humans. METHODS: Study 1: Twenty-four healthy adult  subjects with a BP between 120-160/80-100 mmHg were randomized to Eucommia  extract 500 mg three times daily for eight weeks. Automatic 24-hour ambulatory  blood pressure monitoring (24-h ABPM) was utilized at baseline and after eight  weeks. Study 2: The effect of the Eucommia extract on isoproterenol-stimulated  lipolysis was evaluated in a human fat cell assay to determine whether Eucommia  was a beta-adrenergic blocker. Study 3: Thirty healthy adult subjects with a BP  between 120-160/80-100 mmHg were randomized to 1 g Eucommia extract three times  daily for two weeks with 24-h ABPM at baseline and after two weeks. RESULTS:  Study 1: There was no toxicity or any difference in BP between the two groups.  Study 2: Eucommia at 0.5\% w/v reduced isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis from  2.67 to 1.4 times the buffer control (P{$<$}0.001). Study 3: The Eucommia extract was  well-tolerated and reduced BP by an average of 7.5/3.9 mmHg (P{$<$}0.008).  CONCLUSION: The standardized Eucommia extract reduced BP and has beta-adrenergic  blocking activity. Eucommia may be an appropriate nutraceutical intervention for  prehypertension.},

The present work was carried out to study the anti-diabetic  efficacy and mechanisms of 34 TCMs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Streptozotocin  (STZ)-diabetic mice were orally administrated with corresponding herbal solution  once a day for 4 weeks. At the end of experiment, the level of plasma glucose,  malondialdehyde (MDA), the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and the serum  aldose reductase (AR) were determined, the effects of TCM extract on  {$\alpha$}-glucosidase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in vitro were also  evaluated. RESULTS: 13 out of the 34 herbs showed a statistically significant  plasma glucose lowering action compared with the diabetic control group.  Biochemical analysis revealed that Atractylodes macrocephala, Codonopsis  pilosula, Dioscorea opposite, Flos lonicerae and Pueraria lobata may retard the  progression of diabetes via reduce the blood glucose level and prevent the  increase of AR activity. Other tested herbs, such as Ramulus cinnamomi,  Cinnamomum cassia, and Eucommia ulmoides, showed the antidiabetic ability by  either prevent the decrease in SOD activity or suppress the increase of MDA.  Zymologic assay reveals that Pueraria lobata and Anemarrhena asphodeloides showed  the highest inhibition against {$\alpha$}-glucosidase and ACE respectively. Interestingly,  the post-treatment glucose levels and AR activity were positively correlated with  kidney/body weight of 34 herbs treated diabetic mice (p = 0.02, 0.04  respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Several potential antidiabetic herbs derived from  Chinese traditional pharmacopeia such as Dioscorea opposite, Pueraria lobata,  Codonopsis pilosula and Ramulus cinnamomi, have been found to exert a beneficial  action on diabetes and diabetic complications via multi-mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis of lupus nephritis is mainly attributable to a complex interaction between the innate and adaptive immune systems, including T and B  cell function abnormalities. In addition to autoantibody production and immune  complex deposition, Th1 and Th17 cytokines may play key roles in the development  and progression of lupus nephritis. Acute onset of severe lupus nephritis remains  a challenge in terms of prevention and treatment. In the present study, we  evaluated the therapeutic effects of DCB-SLE1, an extract of a mixture of four  traditional Chinese medicinal herbs (Atractylodis macrocephalae Rhizoma,  Eucommiae cortex, Lonicerae caulis, and Hedyotidis diffusae Herba), on an  accelerated severe lupus nephritis model, characterized by acute onset of  proteinuria, azotemia, autoantibody production, and development of severe  nephritis, induced by twice weekly injection of New Zealand black/white F1 mice  with Salmonella-type lipopolysaccharide. DCB-SLE1 was administered daily by  gavage starting 2 days after the first dose of induction of lipopolysaccharide,  and the mice were euthanized at week 1 or week 5. The results showed that  DCB-SLE1 significantly ameliorated the hematuria, proteinuria, renal dysfunction,  and severe renal lesions by 1) suppression of B cell activation and decreased  autoantibody production; 2) negative regulation of T cell  activation/proliferation and natural killer cell activity; 3) suppression of  IL-18, IL-6, and IL-17 production and blocking of NF-{$\kappa$}B activation in the kidney;  and 4) prevention of lymphoid and renal apoptosis. These results show that  DCB-SLE1 can protect the kidney from autoimmune response-mediated acute and  severe damage through systemic immune modulation and anti-inflammation pathways.},

Sprague-Dawley rats were used and randomly  assigned to the normal group and the TGEUS group (400\,mg/kg body weight/day).  Daily oral administration of TGEUS was found to increase significantly the  biomechanical quality of the femur. The mechanical changes were associated with a  bone mineral density (BMD) increase or even with some improvements in  microarchitecture. Micro-CT analysis of the distal femur showed that TGEUS  significantly increased the bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV), connectivity  density (Conn.D), trabecular number (Tb.N) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and  decreased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) in  normal rats.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effect of Bushen Qiangdu Recipe (BSQDR) on osteoporosis and bone loss in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS:  Patients with AS were randomly assigned to two groups. The 288 patients in the  treatment group received BSQDR (consisting of cibotii rhizoma, antler, prepared  rehmannia root, epimedium herb, rhizoma drynariae, teasel root, eucommia bark,  pangolin scales, etc., one dose daily, taken in two portions, once in the morning  and once in the evening). The 72 patients in the control group received SIDSM and  sulfasalazine. The therapeutic course for both was six months. Clinical symptoms,  pillow distance from the wall, hand distance from the ground, jaw distance from  the handle, chest mobility, Schober test, spinal mobility and other signs of  disease activity indices (ESR and CRP) were observed in patients before and after  treatment. The bone mineral density (BMD) testing was performed in the lumbar  spine, the femur, the forearm, and the heels, etc. Osteocalcin (BGP), calcitonin,  parathyroid hormone (PTH), etc. bone metabolic indices were detected. RESULTS:  BASFI, BASDAI, the overall assessment, the spinal pain, pillow distance from the  wall, hand distance from the ground, jaw distance from the handle, chest  mobility, Schober test, spinal mobility, and so on were all improved to some  extent when compared with before treatment in the treatment group (P{$<$}0.05). The  ESR and CRP decreased to various degrees, showing statistical significance when  compared with before treatment (P {$<$}0.01). BGP increased and PTH decreased,  showing statistical difference when compared with before treatment (P{$<$}0.05). The  BMD in patients' lumbar spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, femoral trochanter  increased to various degrees. The calcaneal intensity index, blood uric acid  (BUA) and SOS values also increased more than before treatment, showing  statistical significance (P{$<$}0.05). Long-term oral administration of BSQDR was  safe, with no obvious adverse reaction. CONCLUSIONS: BSQDR showed significant  effect in treatment of AS. It could regulate the bone metabolic level in  patients, attenuate the immune inflammatory response, improve the spine and joint  activities functions, increase bone formation, reduce bone resorption, thereby,  enhancing the BMD, showing significant therapeutic effect on osteoporosis in AS  patients.},

  abstract = {Background. Traditional Chinese postpartum care is believed to help in the recovery of women after delivery. Objective. This study investigated the  association of elements in dietary and herbal therapy with uterine involution.  Methods. Indices of uterine involution were measured ultrasonographically in 127  postpartum women between 4-6 weeks after delivery. A self-reported retrospective  questionnaire was used to query women about their frequencies of taking herbal  medicines and consuming special diets during the first month after delivery.  Correlation coefficients were calculated to identify the associations, then the  regression models were used to identify the predictors. Result. Among the herbal  medicines and diet, consumption of Eucommia ulmoides (E. ulmoides) negatively  correlated with the AP diameter of the uterus and the cavity. E. ulmoides was  also the only predictor of maximum AP diameter of the uterus, AP diameter of the  uterus 5 cm from the fundus, and the maximum AP diameter of the cavity. Moreover,  consumption of Sheng-hau-tang was significantly correlated with anteverted uterus  and was a predictor of anteverted uterus. Conclusion. E. ulmoides and  Sheng-hau-tang positively correlated with the degree of uterine involution after  delivery, implying that both therapies might possess the pharmacological efficacy  of uterine contraction in postpartum women.},

  abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: GCSB-5 (traditional name: Chungpa-Juhn), an herbal medicine composed of 6 crude herbs (Saposhnikovia divaricata Schiskin, Achyranthis  bidentata Blume, Acanthopanax sessiliflorum Seem, Cibotium baromets J. Smith,  Glycine max Meriill, and Eucommia ulmoides Oliver), has been widely used in Asia  for treatment of neuropathic and inflammatory diseases. This study investigated  the protective effect of GCSB-5 against peripheral nerve injury in vitro and in  vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After left sciatic nerve transection, rats received  oral administration of GCSB-5 (30, 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg), or saline (vehicle),  respectively, once daily for 8 weeks. Motor functional recovery and axonal nerve  regeneration were evaluated by measurement of sciatic functional index (SFI),  sensory regeneration distance, and gastrocnemius muscle mass ratio. The  myelinated axon number was counted by morphometric analysis. In the in vitro  study, the effects of GCSB-5 on H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative damage in SH-SY5Y  cells were investigated by measurement of cell viability, production of reactive  oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, release of lactate dehydrogenease  (LDH), and cellular glutathione contents. Neurite outgrowth was also determined.  RESULTS: After 8 weeks of nerve transection, SFI, regeneration distance, and  gastrocnemius muscle mass ratio and myelinated axon number showed a significant  decrease and these decreases were attenuated by GCSB-5. GCSB-5 significantly  inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced cell death and oxidative stress, as evidenced by  decreases in production of ROS and lipid peroxidation and release of LDH, and by  increase in total GSH content. CONCLUSIONS: The neuroprotective effect afforded  by GCSB-5 is due in part to reduced oxidative stress.},

However, the  compounds involved in their anti-obesity effect have not been fully elucidated.  In this Letter, we examined the anti-obesity effect of Eucommia green leaf  extract (EGLE) divided into five fractions with high porous polystyrene gel and  of the compounds isolated, geniposidic acid, asperuloside and chlorogenic acid,  respectively. A metabolic syndrome-like clinical model in mice was generated by  feeding a 40\% high-fat diet to examine the anti-obesity effects of chronic  administration of test substance. After 4 weeks, body weight, white adipose  tissue weight, plasma triglyceride levels and total cholesterol levels in the  model mice were significantly inhibited by the 30\% MeOH fraction (containing much  higher levels of asperuloside than the other fractions), and these effects were  similar to those of EGLE. Chronic administration of isolated asperuloside in  Eucommia leaves suppressed increases in model mouse body weight, white adipose  tissue weight, plasma triglyceride levels and free fatty acids levels. These  results suggest that asperuloside in Eucommia leaves has important anti-obesity  effects.},

We investigated inhibitory effects of EuO leaf ethanol extracts on  H(2)O(2)-induced apoptosis in rat osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and underlying  mechanisms. Locally-grown Duzhong leaves were extracted with ethanol. MC3T3-E1  cells were treated with EuO (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 \textmu g/ml) for 24 h, and  then H(2)O(2) (800 \textmu mol/L) for an additional 24 h. Cell survival rate, percentage  of apoptosis, and expressions of caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9 were examined using  3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay,  microscopic analysis, Western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase  chain reaction (RT-PCR). The final EuO leaf ethanol extract powder was detected  to contain caffeotannic acid at 58 mg/g and geniposide at 3.45 mg/g by high  performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). EuO remarkably restrained cell  oxidative damage and increased cell survival rate in a dose-dependent manner: 0  \textmu g/ml, 0.21; 6.25 \textmu g/ml, 0. 28; 12.5 \textmu g/ml, 0.31; 25 \textmu g/ml, 0.48; 50 \textmu g/ml, 0.54;  and 100 \textmu g/ml, 0.66 (P{$<$}0.05), with the half-effective concentration being around  25 \textmu g/ml. MTT results were confirmed by microscopic analysis. Western blotting  and RT-PCR analyses showed that the expressions of caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9 were  significantly decreased in the EuO-treated cells compared with the control (EuO-  and H(2)O(2)-free) (P{$<$}0.05), with the half-effective concentration of EuO ranging  from 12.5 to 25 \textmu g/ml. We conclude that the ethanol-extracted EuO leaf extracts  promoted the growth of MC3T3-E1 cells, and suppressed the H(2)O(2)-induced  apoptosis in a rat MC3T3-E1 osteogenic cell model, likely due to the inhibition  of caspases' activities. The results indicate that EuO is a potent antioxidant,  which may contribute to its many cellular protective functions, including the  promotion of bone growth.},

Mice  received a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of A{$\beta$}(25-35) 6 nmol  as the critical factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognition was evaluated using  Y-maze, passive avoidance, and Morris water maze tests.

In addition, EUE decreased the escape  latencies with A{$\beta$}(25-35)-induced cognitive impairments in the Morris water maze  test. In the probe trial session, EUE increased time spent in the target  quadrant. In the in vitro study, EUE was found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase  (AChE) activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value; 172 {$\mu$}g/ml). Ex vivo  study, EUE significantly inhibited AChE activity in the hippocampus and frontal  cortex. These results demonstrate that EUE possesses potent neuroprotective  effects and that its beneficial effects are mediated, in part, by AChE  inhibition, and therefore, might be a potential candidate in neurodegenerative  diseases such as AD.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats  were randomly divided into 3 groups (12 rats each group), and treated orally with  100 mg/kg/d of captopril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor), 100  mg/kg/d of epalrestat (an aldose reductase inhibitor) and 300 mg/kg/d of lignans  by gavage daily for 16 weeks, respectively. Sex-, age-, and number-matched  spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats, were treated  with distilled water (vehicle) as controls. The rats were weighed weekly. Mean  arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured periodically by non-invasive  blood pressure monitoring. They were sacrificed at the end of experiment  (26-week-old). Superior mesenteric artery and aorta were isolated for  determination of histomorphometry and the expression of aldose reductase by  immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Captopril and lignans, but not epalrestat,  decreased mean arterial blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.  Vascular remodeling was improved in all three treated groups by histomorphometry.  CONCLUSIONS: Both lignans and epalrestat reversed hypertensive vascular  remodeling. Aldose reductase played a vital role in the pathologic process of  hypertensive vascular remodeling rather than elevation of blood pressure. These  data suggested that aldose reductase could be a new therapeutic target for the  treatment of cardiovascular diseases.},

This study was conducted to elucidate  the mechanisms underlying the plasma triglyceride-lowering effect of E. ulmoides  leaves. RESULTS: Rats were divided into four groups: a normal group, a group fed  a high-fat/high-fructose diet (untreated group) and two groups fed a  high-fat/high-fructose diet and E. ulmoides tea (4 or 20 g L(-1) extract, treated  groups). Plasma triglyceride concentrations were reduced in treated groups in a  dose-dependent manner compared with the untreated group. DNA microarray analysis  revealed that genes involved in hepatic {$\alpha$}-, {$\beta$}- and {$\omega$}-oxidation, mainly related to  the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {$\alpha$} and {$\delta$} signalling pathway, were  up-regulated in the treated group. High-performance liquid chromatography  analysis showed that E. ulmoides leaves contain three phytochemicals that make up  60 mg g(-1) of the material and are likely to be the active components.  CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the promotion of fatty acid oxidation,  probably by the action of phytochemicals, participates in the ameliorative effect  of E. ulmoides leaves on hypertriglyceridaemia. These findings provide the  scientific evidence for the functionality of E. ulmoides.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Metabolite identification from tandem mass spectra is an important problem in metabolomics, underpinning subsequent metabolic modelling and network analysis. Yet, currently this task requires matching the observed spectrum against a database of reference spectra originating from similar equipment and closely matching operating parameters, a condition that is rarely satisfied in public repositories. Furthermore, the computational support for identification of molecules not present in reference databases is lacking. Recent efforts in assembling large public mass spectral databases such as MassBank have opened the door for the development of a new genre of metabolite identification methods. RESULTS: We introduce a novel framework for prediction of molecular characteristics and identification of metabolites from tandem mass spectra using machine learning with the support vector machine. Our approach is to first predict a large set of molecular properties of the unknown metabolite from salient tandem mass spectral signals, and in the second step to use the predicted properties for matching against large molecule databases, such as PubChem. We demonstrate that several molecular properties can be predicted to high accuracy and that they are useful in de novo metabolite identification, where the reference database does not contain any spectra of the same molecule.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Natural rubber produced by plants, known as polyisoprene, is the most widely used isoprenoid polymer. Plant polyisoprenes can be classified into two  types; cis-polyisoprene and trans-polyisoprene, depending on the type of  polymerization of the isoprene unit. More than 2000 species of higher plants  produce latex consisting of cis-polyisoprene. Hevea brasiliensis (rubber tree)  produces cis-polyisoprene, and is the key source of commercial rubber. In  contrast, relatively few plant species produce trans-polyisoprene. Currently,  trans-polyisoprene is mainly produced synthetically, and no plant species is used  for its commercial production. RESULTS: To develop a plant-based system suitable  for large-scale production of trans-polyisoprene, we selected a  trans-polyisoprene-producing plant, Eucommia ulmoides Oliver, as the target for  genetic transformation. A full-length cDNA (designated as EuIPI, Accession No.  AB041629) encoding isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase (IPI) was isolated from E.  ulmoides. EuIPI consisted of 1028 bp with a 675-bp open reading frame encoding a  protein with 224 amino acid residues. EuIPI shared high identity with other plant  IPIs, and the recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli showed IPI  enzymatic activity in vitro. EuIPI was introduced into E. ulmoides via  Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Transgenic lines of E. ulmoides  overexpressing EuIPI showed increased EuIPI expression (up to 19-fold that of the  wild-type) and a 3- to 4-fold increase in the total content of  trans-polyisoprenes, compared with the wild-type (non-transgenic root line)  control. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the expression level of EuIPI by overexpression  increased accumulation of trans-polyisoprenes in transgenic E. ulmoides. IPI  catalyzes the conversion of isopentenyl diphosphate to its highly electrophilic  isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate, which is the first step in the biosynthesis of  all isoprenoids, including polyisoprene. Our results demonstrated that regulation  of IPI expression is a key target for efficient production of trans-polyisoprene  in E. ulmoides.},

TCM physicians  often prescribe CHP to treat patients with osteoporosis; however, the drugs used  and their patterns of prescriptions have yet to be characterized. This study,  therefore, aimed to evaluate the CHP used for the treatment of osteoporosis in  Taiwan and their prescription patterns. Methods. A cohort of one million randomly  sampled cases from the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was  analyzed to evaluate the frequencies and percentages of herbal formula and single  herb prescriptions for osteoporosis. Association rules were then applied to  evaluate the CHP coprescription patterns and the prevalence of osteoporosis.  Results. The osteoporosis cohort included 16\,544 patients, of whom more than 70\%  had used TCM on one or more occasion. Of these patients, 4\,292 (25.9\%) had been  hospitalized at least once because of fracture. Du-Huo-Ji-Sheng-Tang and Du Zhong  (Cortex Eucommiae) were the most frequently prescribed herbal formula and single  herb, respectively, for the treatment of osteoporosis. Conclusion.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  (PAHs) have carcinogenic, biological and mutagenic effects. In this paper, the  content of 16\,PAHs as representative contaminants in nine Chinese medicinal  herbs, as additives for health foods, was investigated in order to ensure food  safety from this source. A highly sensitive isotope dilution-gas  chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (ID-GC-MS/MS) method combined with gel  permeation chromatography (GPC) and solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed.  Calibration curves showed good linearity for all PAHs (R{$^2$} {$>$} 0.999), and the limit  of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.42 to 2.7\,\textmu g\,kg{$^{-1}$}. Average recoveries for  these compounds were in the range of 52.5-117\%, 52.6-119\% and 81.4-108\% at the  concentrations of 10, 50 and 250\,\textmu g\,kg{$^{-1}$} with RSD of 1.8-15\%, 0.9-15\% and  1.0-15\%, respectively. The proposed method was used for the analysis of nine  Chinese medicinal herbs. Total levels of PAHs varied from 98.2\,\textmu g\,kg{$^{-1}$} (cassia  seed) to 2245\,\textmu g\,kg{$^{-1}$} (eucommia bark). The highest level was found for  phenanthrene (Phe) in liquorice root (631.3\,\textmu g\,kg{$^{-1}$}), indigowoad leaf  (551.0\,\textmu g\,kg{$^{-1}$}), rose flower (435.2\,\textmu g\,kg{$^{-1}$}) and eucommia bark (432.3\,\textmu g\,kg{$^{-1}$}).

The antibacterial  activity of Aucubin was determined. RESULTS: The results showed that the optimum  technology was as follows; The solid-liquid ratio was 1:12, extracted for 50 min  by 0.4\% enzyme at 50 degrees C in pH 6.0. The extraction rate of Aucubin was as  high as 17.892 mg/g. The Aucubin extracted could obviously inhibit the growth of  Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, the MIC of Aucubin against  Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were 4.832 mg/mL and 9.664 mg/mL  respectively. However, Aucubin presented weak inhibitory effect on Streptococcus  pneumonia and MG-hemolytic streptococcus, the MIC of Aucubin against them were  all 28.946 mg/mL.

  abstract = {The cortex of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver is widely used to treat kidney deficiency in traditional Chinese medicine. Its leaves have recently been reported to have  anti-obesity properties in metabolic syndrome-like rat models. Due to a sharp  decline in estrogen production, obesity, together with osteoporosis, are common  problems in postmenopausal women. In this study, we examined the potential effect  of Eucommia leaf extract (ELE) in preventing osteoporosis and obesity induced by  ovariectomy (OVX). Forty-six female Wistar rats were divided into six groups:  Sham-Cont, OVX-Cont, and four OVX groups administered estradiol and different  concentrations of ELE 1.25\%, ELE 2.5\%, and ELE 5\%. Treatments were administered  after ovariectomy at six weeks of age and continued for 12 weeks. OVX induced a  significant decrease in the bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar, femora, and  tibiae, together with a marked increase in body mass index (BMI). The  administration of 5\% ELE led to a significant increase in tibial and femoral BMD,  as well as significantly increased bone-strength parameters when compared with  OVX-Cont rats. According to the suppressed Dpd and increased osteocalcin  concentrations in ELE 5\% rats, we suggest that varying proportions of bone  formation and bone absorption contributed to the enhanced BMD in the femora and  tibiae. In addition, significant decreases in body weight, BMI and fat tissue in  5\% ELE rats were also observed. These results suggest that ELE may have curative  properties for BMD and BMI in OVX rats, and could provide an alternative therapy  for the prevention of both postmenopausal osteoporosis and obesity.},

(EUE), has commonly been used to fortify the muscles and lungs, lower blood pressure, prevent  miscarriage, improve the tone of liver and kidneys, and promote longevity the  traditional tonic medicines of Korea, China, and Japan. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this  study, we investigated that the neuroprotective activities and possible  mechanisms of EUE aqueous extract in hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced  neuronal cell death in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We  examined the effects of EUE against H(2)O(2)-induced cytotoxicity, DNA  condensation, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of  mitochondria membrane potential (MMP), the proteolysis of cleaved poly-ADP-ribose  polymerase (PARP), and the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cleaved caspase-3, and  release of cytochrome c. Moreover, we attempted to determine whether EUE  suppressed the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase  1/2 (ERK 1/2), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt. RESULTS: Pretreatment  with EUE increased cell viability and inhibited cytotoxicity and DNA  condensation. EUE also attenuated the increase in ROS production and MMP  reduction. Western blot data revealed that EUE inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced up- or  down-regulation of cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL. The EUE  inhibited release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, and  significantly attenuated H(2)O(2)-induced phosphorylation of JNK, p38 MAPK, ERK  1/2, and PI3K/Akt. CONCLUSION: The potent neuroprotective capacity of EUE, shown  in these experiments, may potentially be applied in the prevention or treatment  of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).},

Homologues of genes coding for rubber particle membrane proteins that participate  in the synthesis of high-molecular poly-isoprene in latex were isolated, as well  as those encoding known major latex proteins (MLPs). MLPs extensively shared  ESTs, indicating their abundant expression during trans-polyisoprene rubber  biosynthesis. The six mevalonate pathway genes which are implicated in the  synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), a starting material of poly-isoprene  biosynthesis, were isolated, and their role in IPP biosynthesis was confirmed by  functional complementation of suitable yeast mutants. Genes encoding five  full-length trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthases were also isolated, and two  among those synthesized farnesyl diphosphate from IPP and dimethylallyl  diphosphate, an assumed intermediate of rubber biosynthesis. This study should  provide a valuable resource for further studies of rubber synthesis in E.  ulmoides.},

During PCD, the degradation of genomic DNA  is catalyzed by endonucleases. However, to date, no endonuclease has been shown  to participate in secondary xylem development. Two novel Ca(2+) -dependent DNase  genes, EuCaN1 and EuCaN2, were identified from the differentiating secondary  xylem of the tree Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., their functions were studied by DNase  activity assay, in situ hybridization, protein immunolocalization and  virus-induced gene silencing experiments. Full-length cDNAs of EuCaN1 and EuCaN2  contained an open reading frame of 987 bp, encoding two proteins of 328 amino  acids with SNase-like functional domains. The genomic DNA sequence for EuCaN1 had  no introns, while EuCaN2 had 8 introns. EuCaN1 and EuCaN2 digested ssDNA and  dsDNA with Ca(2+) -dependence at neutral pH. Their expression was confined to  differentiating secondary xylem cells and the proteins were localized in the  nucleus. Their activity dynamics was closely correlated with secondary xylem  development. Secondary xylem cell differentiation is influenced by RNAi of  endonuclease genes. The results provide evidence that the Ca(2+) -dependent  DNases are involved in secondary xylem development.},

Common  therapies that are used for the treatment of psoriasis include topical, systemic,  phototherapy, combination, herbal therapy and novel molecules. Topically used  agents include Vit D, calcipotriol, corticosteroids, dithranol and retinoids etc.  Systemically used agents include methotrexate and cyclosporine etc. Phototherapy  includes UV-B, Psoralen plus ultraviolet therapy and excimer laser etc. These  therapies have a number of potential problems, such as limited in efficacy,  inconvenience, organ toxicity, carcinogenic and broadband immunosuppression. In  natural treatment a variety of natural agents such as methanolic extracts of  duzhong (Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.), yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis,) linseed oil,  fish oil, and Indigo naturalis etc., that modulates T cell and cytokine action at  various steps along with the pathogenic sequence have been developed. But till  now there is no more in vivo, dose and its efficacy data has been established.  Current therapy includes biologicals, small molecules inhibitor and enzyme  inhibitors etc, which serve as novel therapeutic options for psoriasis treatment.  All these avoid the side effects of the prebiologically developed systemic agents  including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and bone marrow suppression. Currently,  Denilukin diftitox, Efalizumab, Alefacept, Ustekinumab and Etanercept are  approved by the FDA, and others molecules are at clinical stage. Patents issued  by the US office are also included in current psoriasis treatment scenario. In  the United States, biologicals are widely used for moderate-to-severe psoriasis.  But because of the high cost of medication and their availability in injection  form, it remains to be seen how widely these agents will be utilized worldwide.

This study developed a centrifugal  ultrafiltration-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for  screening and identification of bioactive compounds in E. ulmoides leaves binding  with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Six active compounds were screened, isolated,  and elucidated by their ultraviolet (UV), electrospray ionization-mass  spectrometry (ESI-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data as geniposidic  acid (1), caffeic acid (2), chlorogenic acid (3), quercetin-3-O-sambubioside (4),  rutin (5), and isoquercitrin (6). The interaction between active compounds and  BSA was investigated in the absence and presence of other compounds by quenching  the intrinsic BSA fluorescence. The results indicated that the structures  significantly affected the binding process. The values of binding constants for  compounds 2-6 were in the range of 10(5)-10(6) mol L(-1), while geniposidic acid  (1) hardly quenching the BSA intrinsic fluorescence. However, the quenching  process of geniposidic acid was easily affected in the presence of other active  compounds. The formation of the geniposidic acid-phenylpropanoid (flavonoid)  complex could increase the binding affinity of geniposidic acid with BSA;  however, the increased steric hindrance of the complex may make phenylpropanoid  or flavonoid dissociate from BSA and then decrease their affinities.},

  abstract = {Eucommia leaves (Eucommia ulmoides Oliver) contain chlorogenic acid (a caffeic acid derivative) and geniposidic acid and asperuloside (ASP), iridoid glucosides  used in beverages. We used a metabolic syndrome rat model, produced by feeding a  35~\% high-fat diet (HFD), to examine potential anti-obesity and anti-metabolic  syndrome effects and mechanisms of chronic administration of ASP. These effects  were compared with Eucommia leaf extract (ELE), the positive control, which  exhibits anti-obesity effects. A total of six rats were studied for 3 months in  five groups. ASP suppressed body weight, visceral fat weight, food intake and  circulating levels of glucose, insulin and lipids, and increased the plasma  adiponectin level in rats on a HFD. These effects are similar to those of ELE,  except for the influence on the plasma glucose level. RT-PCR studies showed that  ASP (like ELE with known anti-obesity effects) diminished isocitrate  dehydrogenase 3{$\alpha$}, NADH dehydrogenase flavoprotein 1 (Comp I) mRNA and fatty acid  synthase levels (white adipose tissue), increased carnitine palmitoyltransferase  1{$\alpha$} and acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very-long-chain mRNA levels (liver), and increased  Glut4, citrate synthase, isocitrate dehydrogenase 3{$\alpha$}, succinyl CoA synthase,  peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, dihydrolipoamide succinyl transferase and  succinate dehydrogenase mRNA levels (skeletal muscle) under HFD conditions.  Interestingly, ASP administration resulted in significantly increased mRNA levels  of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in the brown adipose tissue of HFD-fed rats; ELE  did not affect the expression of UCP1. The increased expression of UCP1 may be  negated by many ingredients other than ASP in the ELE. These findings suggest  that chronic administration of ASP stimulates anti-obesity and anti-metabolic  syndrome activity in HFD-fed rats across several organs, similar to ELE  administration; thus, ASP may be an important ingredient of ELE.},

  abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the protective effects and the underlying mechanism of Eucommia lignans against hypertensive renal injury. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: Ten-week-old Wistar Kyoto rats and age matched spontaneously  hypertension rats were used in the study. The SHR were randomly divided into 4  groups (n=7 for each group) and received different treatment for 16 weeks, which  including saline, Captopril, Epalrestat and Eucommia lignans, respectively.  System blood pressures of the rats were monitored once every 4 weeks.  N-Acetyl-{$\beta$}-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity and the ratio of albumin and urinary  creatinine were chosen as the indices of kidney function. Then the structure and  renal collagen type III expression of glomerular basement membrane were observed  by microscopy and the renal aldose reductase (AR) expression was measured by  immunohistochemistry. In vitro, the proliferation of mesangial cells induced by  AngII was assayed by MTT, and the mRNA expression of AR was measured by  RT-real-time PCR. RESULTS: The renal function, evaluated by NAG enzyme activity  and the ratio of albumin to urinary creatinine, was significantly ameliorated by  Eucommia lignans treatment. Meanwhile, Eucommia lignans decreased both the  protein (P{$<$}0.05) and the mRNA expressed lever of AR (P{$<$}0.05). Eucommia lignans  also decreased the high expression of collagen type III in SHR (P{$<$}0.05) and  inhibited the proliferation of renal mesangial cells induced by AngII (P{$<$}0.05).  CONCLUSION: Eucommia lignans have protective effects against hypertensive renal  injury, and the protective effects may be partly due to inhibition of aldose  reductase.},

  abstract = {A sensitive, accurate, rapid and robust LC-MS-MS method for the quantification of aucubin, a major bioactive constituent of Aucuba japonica, Eucommia ulmoides and  Plantago asiatica, was established and validated in rat plasma. Plasma samples  were simply precipitated by adding methanol and the supernatant was  chromatographed by a Diamonsil\textregistered{} C(18)(2) column with the mobile phase comprising  a mixture of 10\,mm ammonium acetate in methanol and that in water with the ratio  of 50:50 (v/v). Quantification of aucubin was performed by mass spectrometry in  the multiple-reaction monitoring mode with positive atmospheric ionization at m/z  364\,\textrightarrow\,149 for aucubin, and m/z 380\,\textrightarrow\,165 for catalpol (IS), respectively. The  retention time was 2.47 and 2.44\,min for aucubin and the IS, respectively. The  calibration curve (10.0-30,000\,ng/mL) was linear (r{$^2$} \,{$>$}\,0.99) and the lower limit  of quantification was 10.0\,ng/mL in the rat plasma sample. The method showed  satisfactory results such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy,  recovery, freeze-thaw and long-term stability. This simple LC-MS method was  successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study carried out in Sprague-Dawley  rats after oral administration of aucubin at a single dose of 50\,mg/kg. Herein  the pharmacokinetic study of aucubin is reported for the first time.},

The microbial PDG is stable in pH range from 3 to 11 but less stable at  temperature higher than 90 \textdegree C and in light exposure. During the fermentation, PDG  production outside cells starts at the later stage of cell growth when the  residual sugar in the medium was low.

The separation was carried out on an Acquity UPLC BEH  C(18) column with 0.1\% formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile as the  mobile phase under gradient conditions. The developed method was applied to the  quality assessment of various E. ulmoides samples, including different medicinal  parts, differently processed bark and bark from different habitats. The results  showed that the branches of E. ulmoides were not suitable for medicinal use. The  process of carbonizing led to significant loss of major components, whereas the  process of stir-frying with salt-water enhanced the extraction of chlorogenic  acid with negligible loss of the other components. The contents of the  investigated compounds varied very remarkably for the bark of E. ulmoides  collected from different habitats. This study might provide a comprehensive  method for the quality assessment of E. ulmoides.},

In this study, we tested the effects of EUE aqueous extract in graded  doses to protect and enhance cognition in scopolamine-induced learning and memory  impairments in mice. EUE significantly improved the impairment of short-term or  working memory induced by scopolamine in the Y-maze and significantly reversed  learning and memory deficits in mice as measured by the passive avoidance and  Morris water maze tests. One day after the last trial session of the Morris water  maze test (probe trial session), EUE dramatically increased the latency time in  the target quadrant in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, EUE significantly  inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance  (TBARS) activities in the hippocampus and frontal cortex in a dose-dependent  manner. EUE also markedly increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and  phosphorylation of cAMP element binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus of  scopolamine-induced mice. Based on these findings, we suggest that EUE may be  useful for the treatment of cognitive deficits, and that the beneficial effects  of EUE are mediated, in part, by cholinergic signaling enhancement and/or  protection.},

Here, we examined the potential regulatory effects of  Eucommia ulmoides Oliver extracts (EUE) on hepatic dyslipidemia and its related  mechanisms by in vitro and in vivo studies. EUE and its two active constituents,  aucubin and geniposide, inhibited palmitate-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  stress, reducing hepatic lipid accumulation through secretion of apolipoprotein B  and associated triglycerides and cholesterol in human HepG2 hepatocytes. To  determine how EUE diminishes the ER stress response, lysosomal and proteasomal  protein degradation activities were analyzed. Although proteasomal activity was  not affected, lysosomal enzyme activities including V-ATPase were significantly  increased by EUE as well as aucubin and geniposide in HepG2 cells. Treatment with  the V-ATPase inhibitor, bafilomycin, reversed the inhibition of ER stress,  secretion of apolipoprotein B, and hepatic lipid accumulation induced by EUE or  its component, aucubin or geniposide. In addition, EUE was determined to regulate  hepatic dyslipidemia by enhancing lysosomal activity and to regulate ER stress in  rats fed a high-fat diet. Together, these results suggest that EUE and its active  components enhance lysosomal activity, resulting in decreased ER stress and  hepatic dyslipidemia.},

In addition, the major characteristic fragmentation  pathways of iridoids and lignans were investigated. The higher reusability and  stability of the immobilized HSA allow the method cost-effective and  high-throughput. Compared with conventional HPLC-MS/MS for chemical fingerprint  analysis, SPR-HPLC-MS/MS is simple and easy to provide biochemical fingerprint,  moreover, it is easy to identify low-content HSA binders because of the sample  clean-up/concentration procedure.},

The stem bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (a member of the  Eucommiaceae family), which is also known as Du-Zhong, is a traditional Chinese  medicine commonly used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. However, the  mechanisms underlying the effects of Eucommia in the treatment of arthritis of  the knee require further study. The present study investigated the effects of an  aqueous extract of Eucommia on the articular cartilage (by Mankin's grade) and  the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), MMP-3 and MMP-13 in the serum  and synovial fluid in a rat model of osteoarthritis. The serum levels of MMP-1,  -3 and -13 were measured by double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay (ELISA) at weeks 1, 2 and 4. The levels of MMP-1, -3 and 13 were  significantly decreased in the rats treated with Eucommia compared with those in  the control rats (P{$<$}0.05). Histopathological examination results indicated a  lower Mankin's grade in the Eucommia group compared with that of the control  rats. Therefore, Eucommia was demonstrated to have a cartilage-protecting effect  in rats with osteoarthritis, potentially by improving cartilage metabolism,  regulating the degradation of the extracellular matrix of the articular  cartilage, and inhibiting apoptosis in chondrocytes, thereby slowing down joint  degeneration.},

Rats were orally treated with EUCE in different doses prior to an  intraperitoneal injection of 1\,mg/kg CCl4. Acute injection of CCl4 decreased  plasma triglyceride but increased hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol as  compared to control rats. On the other hand, the pretreatment with EUCE  diminished these effects at a dose-dependent manner. CCl4 treatment decreased  glutathione (GSH) and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) accompanied by activated  P450 2E1. The pretreatment with EUCE significantly improved these deleterious  effects of CCl4. CCl4 treatment increased P450 2E1 activation and ApoB  accumulation. Pretreatment with EUCE reversed these effects. ER stress response  was significantly increased by CCl4, which was inhibited by EUCE. One of the  possible ER stress regulatory mechanisms, lysosomal activity, was examined. CCl4  reduced lysosomal enzymes that were reversed with the EUCE. The results indicate  that oral pretreatment with EUCE may protect liver against CCl4-induced hepatic  lipid accumulation. ER stress and its related ROS regulation are suggested as a  possible mechanism in the antidyslipidemic effect of EUCE.},

  abstract = {Pseudocercospora is a large cosmopolitan genus of plant pathogenic fungi that are commonly associated with leaf and fruit spots as well as blights on a wide range  of plant hosts. They occur in arid as well as wet environments and in a wide  range of climates including cool temperate, sub-tropical and tropical regions.  Pseudocercospora is now treated as a genus in its own right, although formerly  recognised as either an anamorphic state of Mycosphaerella or having  mycosphaerella-like teleomorphs. The aim of this study was to sequence the  partial 28S nuclear ribosomal RNA gene of a selected set of isolates to resolve  phylogenetic generic limits within the Pseudocercospora complex. From these data,  14 clades are recognised, six of which cluster in Mycosphaerellaceae.  Pseudocercospora s. str. represents a distinct clade, sister to Passalora  eucalypti, and a clade representing the genera Scolecostigmina, Trochophora and  Pallidocercospora gen. nov., taxa formerly accommodated in the Mycosphaerella  heimii complex and characterised by smooth, pale brown conidia, as well as the  formation of red crystals in agar media. Other clades in Mycosphaerellaceae  include Sonderhenia, Microcyclosporella, and Paracercospora. Pseudocercosporella  resides in a large clade along with Phloeospora, Miuraea, Cercospora and  Septoria. Additional clades represent Dissoconiaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae,  Cladosporiaceae, and the genera Xenostigmina, Strelitziana, Cyphellophora and  Thedgonia. The genus Phaeomycocentrospora is introduced to accommodate  Mycocentrospora cantuariensis, primarily distinguished from Pseudocercospora  based on its hyaline hyphae, broad conidiogenous loci and hila. Host specificity  was considered for 146 species of Pseudocercospora occurring on 115 host genera  from 33 countries. Partial nucleotide sequence data for three gene loci, ITS,  EF-1{$\alpha$}, and ACT suggest that the majority of these species are host specific.  Species identified on the basis of host, symptomatology and general morphology,  within the same geographic region, frequently differed phylogenetically,  indicating that the application of European and American names to Asian taxa, and  vice versa, was often not warranted.

  abstract = {The lignan extracts from the tree bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., a famous traditional Chinese medicine, have been demonstrated to have inhibitory effects  on aldose reductase activity in spontaneously hypertensive rat myocardium. This  study was aimed to investigate the hypertensive cardiac remodeling effects of the  lignan extracts together with epalrestat. Ten-week-old male spontaneously  hypertensive rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 12, each) and  administered 100 mg/kg/d of captopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor),  100 mg/kg/d of epalrestat (aldose reductase inhibitor) or 300 mg/kg/d of lignan  extracts by gavage for 16 weeks. Sex-, age-, and number-matched normotensive  Wistar Kyoto rats with spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with  distilled water (vehicle) as controls. Systolic blood pressures were measured  periodically. Echocardiography examination was taken when rats were 24 weeks old.  We found that both captopril and lignan extracts lowered blood pressure, and  inhibited aldose reductase activity similarly to epalrestat. Echocardiography  examination and histomorphometry indices were improved in all treated groups (p {$<$}  0.05). Therefore, lignan extracts could prevent hypertensive cardiac remodeling,  which is likely related to aldose reductase inhibition.},

Among these traditional uses, to establish the recovery effects on the  damaged organs on the basis of phytochemistry, the barks of E. ulmoides have been  investigated to afford three known phenolic compounds, coniferaldehyde glucoside  (1), bartsioside (2), and feretoside (3), which were found in the family  Eucommiaceae for the first time. The compounds 1-3 were evaluated for their  inducible activities on the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), and heat shock proteins  (HSPs) 27 and 70, along with four compounds, geniposide (4), geniposidic acid  (5), pinoresinol diglucoside (6), and liriodendrin (7), which were previously  reported from E. ulmoides. Compounds 1-7 increased expression of HSF1 by a factor  of 1.214, 1.144, 1.153, 1.114, 1.159, 1.041, and 1.167 at 3\hspace{0.25em}{$\mu$}M, respectively.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro antimicrobial activities of selected 58 ethno-medicinal plant extracts with a view to assess their therapeutic potential.  METHODS: A total of 58 traditional Chinese medicinal plants were carefully  selected based on the literature review and their traditional use. The  antimicrobial activities of ethanol extracts of these medicinal plants were  tested against fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus), yeast (Candida albicans),  gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and  gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). The activities were tested at  three different concentrations of 1.00, 0.10 and 0.01 mg/mL. The data was  analysed using Gene data Screener program. RESULTS: The measured antimicrobial  activities indicated that out of the 58 plant extracts, 15 extracts showed  anti-fungal activity and 23 extracts exhibited anti-bacterial activity. Eight  plant extracts have exhibited both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. For  instance, Eucommia ulmoides, Polygonum cuspidatum, Poria cocos and Uncaria  rhyncophylla showed activity against both bacterial and fungal strains,  indicating their broad spectrum of activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed  that the ethanol extracts of 30 plants out of the selected 58 possess significant  antimicrobial activities. It is interesting to note that the findings from the  current study are consistent with the traditional use. A clear correlation has  also been found between the antimicrobial activity and the flavonoid content of  the plant extracts which is in agreement with the literature. Hence, the results  presented here can be used to guide the selection of potential plant species for  the isolation and structure elucidation of novel antimicrobial compounds in order  to establish the structure-activity relationship. This in turn is expected to  lead the way to the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents for therapeutic use.},

The  images showed that trans-polyisoprene was initially synthesized as granules in  non-articulated laticifers that changed shape to fibers during laticifer  maturation. Non-articulated laticifers are developed from single laticiferous  cells, which are differentiated from surrounding parenchyma cells in the cambium.  Therefore, these observations suggested that trans-polyisoprene biosynthesis  first started in laticifer cells as granules and then the granules accumulated  and fused in the inner space of the laticifers over time. Finally, laticifers  were filled with the synthesized trans-polyisoprene, which formed a fibrous  structure fitting the laticifers shape. Both trans- and cis-polyisoprene are  among the most important polymers naturally produced by plants, and this  microscopic technique combined with histological study should provide useful  information in the fields of plant histology, bioindustry and phytochemistry.},

Among these, chlorogenic acids (CGAs) received considerable attention for their wide distribution and part of  human diet with potential biological effects. CGAs (71 compounds), being esters  of derivatives of cinnamic acids with quinic acid are widely distributed in plant  materials. Coffee is among the highest found in plants, ranging from 4 to 14\%.  Besides, these are reported in plant foods such as apples, pears, carrot, tomato,  sweet potato, Phyllostachys edulis, oilseeds, Prunus domestica L, cherries, and  eggplant. The traditional Chinese medicinal plants such as flowers and buds of  Lonicera japonica Thunb and the leaves of Eucommia ulmodies contained CGAs as  bioactive compound. These play an important role in the formation of roasted  coffee flavor and have a marked influence on coffee cup quality. CGAs are  considered as main precursors of coffee flavor and pigments. Recent technological  advancements in the separation and purification of CGAs such as  molecular-imprinted polymer technique; microwave-assisted extraction; pH gradient  counter current chromatography has also been described. The consumption of coffee  correlated to several health benefits such as reducing the risk of human chronic  diseases such as inflammation, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease owing to its  antioxidant potential.},

Differentially expressed genes  screened out by time-series analysis, GO analysis, and pathway analysis, and four  immune-related genes were selected for further confirmation using RT-qPCR. The  results demonstrated that CA is able to change gene expression and that the  responsive genes (CaN, NFATC2, NFATC2ip, and NFATC3) involved in immune pathways  had been significantly upregulated by CA. Expression of immune factors such as  IL-2R and IFN- {$\gamma$} can be improved by CA to promote activation and proliferation of  T cells, macrophages, and NK cells, thus enhancing their surveillance and killing  abilities, further suppressing the growth rate of tumor cells.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the herbal drugs most often used throughout history for the treatment of osteoporosis; to study their property, flavor and meridian  attribution; and to explore their compatibility. METHODS: The "Chinese Medical  Classics" (upgrade) CD-ROM was used to retrieve historical prescriptions for the  treatment of osteoporosis, and these were collected and sorted. Property, flavor  and meridian attribution were determined, and the rules of herbal administration  were determined by cluster analysis. RESULTS: A total of 389 prescriptions were  found, involving 238 herbal drugs, with a total frequency of appearance of 4,236.  Commonly used medications were Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae, Radix Rehmanniae  praeparata, Cortex Cinnamomi, Cortex Eucommiae, Poria, Herba Cistanches, Radix  Aconiti lateralis and Radix Angelicae sinensis. The herbs used included five  kinds of properties, appearing a total of 2,499 times; the two most common ones  were warm and plain. There were seven different drug flavors, occurring 4,151  times; sweet and bitter were the two most common ones. Eight meridian  attributions were identified, appearing a total of 6,374 times; Kidney  (Shen)-meridian and Liver (Gan)-meridian were the two most common ones. The most  common functional categories were yang-tonifying medicinal and blood-tonifying  medicinal, and together these accounted for 37.8\% of the total. The twenty-eight  most commonly used herbal drugs formed 3 prescription clusters: C1: Cortex  Eucommiae, Poria, Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae; C2: Cortex Eucommiae, Poria,  Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae, Cortex Cinnamomi, Radix Rehmanniae praeparata,  Herba Cistanches, Radix Angelicae sinensis, Radix Aconiti lateralis, Semen  Cuscutae; C3: Os Tigris, Rhizoma Atractylodes Alba, Radix Moromdae Officinalis,  Radix Angelicae pubescentis, Radix Paeoniae Alba, Herba Dendrobii, Rhizoma  Alismatis, Fructus Corni, Radix Saposhnikoviae. CONCLUSIONS: Deficiency is the  primary pathogenetic factor in osteoporosis, along with "stagnation" and lack of  flow of water or blood. Clinical treatment of osteoporosis should be based on  Kidney, Liver and Spleen (Pi) supplementation, and complemented by diuresis and  dissolution of stasis, while paying attention to adjustment of the spirit.},

Based on  contour plots and variance analysis, optimum operational conditions for  maximizing extraction yield were found to be extraction time 80 min, ratio of  water to raw material 3, and extraction number 3. Then, we investigated the  protective effect of the E. ulmoides polysaccharides on the tissue peroxidative  damage and abnormal antioxidant levels in ischemia reperfusion (IR) induced renal  toxicity in male albino rabbits. Decrease in all the enzymes (superoxide  dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), glutathione  reductase (GR)) and non-enzymatic antioxidant (glutathione (GSH)), along with an  increase in the lipid peroxidative index (malondialdehyde) was found in all the  renal ischemia reperfusion (RIR) rabbits as compared with normal controls. The  findings indicate that the extract of E. ulmoides polysaccharides can protect the  kidney against IR induced oxidative damage in rabbits.},

Samples' antioxidant capacity was characterized by DPPH radical scavenging  activity, hydroxyl radical scavenging activity, ferrous chelating ability, and  antioxidant capacity in linoleic acid emulsion and in rapeseed oil assays. The  results showed that contents of some active compounds and antioxidant activity  were related to a certain time of the year. Samples collected in August showed  high content of phenolics, and the samples collected in May contained higher  amount of flavonoids than other samples. Leaves collected in May or June  exhibited high contents of rutin, quercetin, geniposidic acid and aucubin. The  August leaves showed stable and high DPPH radical scavenging activity, and  ferrous chelating ability. May samples showed strong inhibitory effects on  oxidation of rapeseed oil and linoleic acid. The DPPH radical scavenging activity  was related to the total phenolics content. Flavonoids played an important role  in the inhibitory effects on rapeseed oil and linoleic acid oxidation. Therefore,  August and May were indicated as the best months to harvest EU leaves for  industry.},

All database entries are now 'is\_a' classified within the ontology, meaning that all of the chemicals are available to semantic reasoning tools that harness the classification hierarchy. We have completely aligned the ontology with the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry-recommended upper level Basic Formal Ontology. Furthermore, we have aligned our chemical classification with the classification of chemical-involving processes in the Gene Ontology (GO), and as a result of this effort, the majority of chemical-involving processes in GO are now defined in terms of the ChEBI entities that participate in them. This effort necessitated incorporating many additional biologically relevant compounds. We have incorporated additional data types including reference citations, and the species and component for metabolites. Finally, our website and web services have had several enhancements, most notably the provision of a dynamic new interactive graph-based ontology visualization.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty 3-month-old female  Sprague-Dawley rats were used and randomly assigned into sham-operated group  (SHAM) and five ovariectomy (OVX) subgroups, i.e. OVX with vehicle (OVX); OVX  with 17{$\alpha$}-ethinylestradiol (E2, 25 {$\mu$}g/kg/day); OVX with TL of graded doses (20,  40, or 80 mg/kg/day). The treatment began 4 weeks after the surgery and lasted  for 16 weeks. in vitro experiments were performed to determine the potential  mechanisms of the anti-osteoporotic effect of TL. RESULTS: Treatment with TL  significantly prevent OVX-induced decrease in biomechanical quality of femur such  as maximum stress and Young׳s modulus. The mechanical changes were associated  with the prevention of a further BMD decrease or even with some improvements in  microarchitecture. TL inhibited BMD decrease in the femur caused by OVX, which  was accompanied by a significant decrease in skeletal remodeling, as was  evidenced by the decreased levels of the bone turnover markers. {$\mu$}CT analysis of  the femoral metaphysis showed how to prevent the deterioration of trabecular  microarchitecture. TL induced primary osteoblastic cell proliferation and  differentiation, inhibition of osteoclastogenesis through an increase in  osteoprotegrin (OPG) and a decrease in NF-{$\kappa$}B ligand (RANKL) expression in vitro.  CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that TL treatment can effectively suppress the loss of  bone mass induced by OVX and in vitro evidence suggests this could be through  actions on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts.},

This study aimed to conduct a large-scale  pharmaco-epidemiologic study and evaluate the frequency and patterns of CHM used  in treating osteoarthritis in Taiwan. METHODS: A complete database (total  22,520,776 beneficiaries) of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) outpatient claims  offered by the National Health Insurance program in Taiwan for the year 2002 was  employed for this research. Patients with osteoarthritis were identified  according to the diagnostic code of the International Classification of Disease  among claimed visiting files. Corresponding prescription files were analyzed, and  an association rule was applied to evaluate the co-prescription of CHM for  treating osteoarthritis. RESULTS: There were 20,059 subjects who visited TCM  clinics for osteoarthritis and received a total of 32,050 CHM prescriptions.  Subjects between 40 and 49~years of age comprised the largest number of those  treated (19.2\%), followed by 50-59~years (18.8\%) and 60-69~years group (18.2\%).  In addition, female subjects used CHMs for osteoarthritis more frequently than  male subjects (female: male\,=\,1.89: l). There was an average of 5.2 items  prescribed in the form of either an individual Chinese herb or formula in a  single CHM prescription for osteoarthritis. Du-zhong (Eucommia bark) was the most  commonly prescribed Chinese single herb, while Du-huo-ji-sheng-tang was the most  commonly prescribed Chinese herbal formula for osteoarthritis. According to the  association rule, the most commonly prescribed formula was Du-huo-ji-sheng-tang  plus Shen-tong-zhu-yu-tang, and the most commonly prescribed triple-drug  combination was Du-huo-ji-sheng-tang, Gu-sui-pu (Drynaria fortune (Kunze) J.  Sm.), and Xu-Duan (Himalaya teasel). Nevertheless, further clinical trials are  needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these CHMs for treating  osteoarthritis. CONCLUSIONS: This study conducted a large scale  pharmaco-epidemiology survey of Chinese herbal medicine use in OA patients by  analyzing the NHIRD in Taiwan in year 2002.},

Using a screening assay for BAX inhibition we determined  that EUE regulates BAX-induced cell death. Among various cell death stimuli  tested EUE regulated palmitate-induced cell death, which involves lysosomal BAX  translocation. EUE rescued palmitate-induced inhibition of lysosomal V-ATPase,  {$\alpha$}-galactosidase, {$\alpha$}-mannosidase, and acid phosphatase, and this effect was  reversed by bafilomycin, a lysosomal V-ATPase inhibitor. The active components of  EUE, aucubin and geniposide, showed similar inhibition of palmitate-induced cell  death to that of EUE through enhancement of lysosome activity. Consistent with  these in vitro findings, EUE inhibited the dyslipidemic condition in a high-fat  diet animal model by regulating the lysosomal localization of BAX. This study  demonstrates that EUE regulates lipotoxicity through a novel mechanism of  enhanced lysosomal activity leading to the regulation of lysosomal BAX activation  and cell death. Our findings further indicate that geniposide and aucubin, active  components of EUE, may be therapeutic candidates for non-alcoholic fatty liver  disease.},

This study aims to investigate  the effects of lignans extracted from the bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. on Ang  II-induced proliferation and extracellular matrix biosynthesis in rat mesangial  cells. METHODS: Rat mesangial cells (RMCs) were cultured in vitro and divided  into six groups (control, Ang II, losartan, and low, middle and high  concentration lignans groups). RMC proliferation was measured by MTT assay.  RT-qPCR and western blotting were used to detect mRNA and protein expression of  collagen type I (Col I), collagen type III (Col III), collagen type IV (Col IV),  fibronectin and aldose reductase (AR). RESULTS: Cellular proliferation induced by  Ang II was significantly suppressed by Eucommia lignans of different  concentrations (P\,=\,0.034, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, and P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Treatment of cells with Ang  II increased Col I, Col III, Col IV, and fibronectin mRNA expression, which was  observed at the protein level (P\,{$<$}\,0.001, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, P\,=\,0.004, and P\,=\,0.004,  respectively). The increased mRNA expression and protein levels of Col I, Col  III, Col IV, and fibronectin were diminished remarkably with by treatment  Eucommia lignans, and elevated AR expression stimulated by Ang II was  significantly inhibited by Eucommia lignans.

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides is an economically important tree species for both herbal medicine and organic chemical industry. Effort to breed varieties with improved  yield and quality is limited by the lack of knowledge on the genetic basis of the  traits. A genetic linkage map of E. ulmoides was constructed from a full-sib  family using sequence-related amplified polymorphism, amplified fragment length  polymorphism, inter-simple sequence repeat and simple sequence repeat markers. In  total, 706 markers were mapped in 25 linkage groups covering 2133 cM. The genetic  linkage map covered approximately 89\% of the estimated E. ulmoides genome with an  average of 3.1 cM between adjacent markers. The present genetic linkage map was  used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting growth-related traits.  Eighteen QTLs were found to explain 12.4\%-33.3\% of the phenotypic variance. This  genetic linkage map provides a tool for marker-assisted selection and for studies  of genome in E. ulmoides.},

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides Oliver is a traditional Chinese medicine and material for functional food with a strong antioxidant activity. To investigate antioxidants  in E. ulmoides Oliver flower, an improved on-line high performance liquid  chromatography method with the radical cation  2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS(+)) as a stable model  free radical for the detection of radical scavenging ability was developed. The  radical concentration, flow rate, and length of reaction coil were optimized with  rutin as a model antioxidant. Under the optimized instrumental set-up, a radical  solution of 0.32 mM ABTS(+) is delivered by a pump equipped with a superloop at  0.5 mL/min through a reaction coil of 10 m \texttimes{} 0.25 mm. This method showed a high  sensitivity since the system noise was reduced by the superloop. The minimum  detecting concentration of the method was in the range of 0.03-0.10 {$\mu$}M for the  negative peaks of rutin, quercetin, ascorbic acid, and {$\alpha$}-tocopherol. Importantly,  the method could be not only used for detection of antioxidants in plant extracts  but also combined with mass spectrometry to obtain the structural messages of  peaks in high performance liquid chromatography profiles. After analysis by the  method, nineteen antioxidants were found in E. ulmoides Oliver flower extract,  and the main active compound was identified as chlorogenic acid.},

The objective of the present study is to  systematically investigate the effects of Du-Zhong cortex extract (DZCE) on  disuse-induced osteoporosis. Rats were randomly divided into four groups, and  three groups were treated with hind limb suspension (HLS). Control and HLS group  received deionized distilled water, while the other two groups received  alendronate (2.0 mg/kg/day) and DZCE (300 mg/kg/day) respectively by intragastric  gavage for six weeks (two weeks prior to and during the four weeks of HLS).  Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, assay of biochemical markers, and three-point  bending test were employed to determine the effect of various treatments on bone  mass, turnover, and strength. The trabecular bone microarchitecture was assessed  by microCT analysis. DZCE could effectively prevent the bone loss induced by HLS,  which was indicated by decreased levels of bone turnover markers as well as the  changes in urinary calcium and phosphorus. The DZCE treatment also enhanced the  biomechanical strength of bone and prevented the deterioration of trabecular bone  microarchitecture. DZCE administration was able to prevent disuse-induced  osteoporosis by regulating the bone metabolism, suggesting that DZCE could be  used as an alternative therapy for the prevention of disuse-induced osteoporosis.},

(EUE) has commonly been used to fortify the muscles and lungs, lower blood pressure, prevent  miscarriage, improve liver and kidney tone, and promote longevity as a  traditional tonic medicine in Korea, China, and Japan. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this  study, we investigated the mechanisms by which EUE protects neuronal cells from  apoptosis induced by the Parkinson's disease (PD)-related neurotoxin,  6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined the  neuroprotective effects of EUE on 6-OHDA-induced neuronal cell death,  cytotoxicity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial  membrane dysfunction. Moreover, we examined whether EUE suppressed  phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  (PI3K)/Akt, and glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3{$\beta$}). Furthermore, the  neuroprotective effects of EUE on 6-OHDA-induced activation of nuclear  factor-kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) was studied in SH-SY5Y cells. RESULTS: Pretreatment of  SH-SY5Y cells with EUE significantly reduced 6-OHDA-induced cell death and  cytotoxicity. EUE inhibited 6-OHDA-induced generation of ROS, which conferred  cytoprotection against 6-OHDA-induced oxidative injury. EUE treatment also  strikingly inhibited 6-OHDA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, EUE  suppressed phosphorylation of JNK, PI3K/Akt, and GSK-3{$\beta$}. Furthermore, EUE blocked  6-OHDA-induced NF-{$\kappa$}B nuclear translocation, an event downstream from JNK,  PI3K/Akt, and GSK-3{$\beta$} phosphorylation. Moreover, chlorogenic acid (CGA), one of  the active constituents of EUE, was also able to reduce 6-OHDA-induced toxicity  in SH-SY5Y cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that EUE  attenuates oxidative stress through activation of JNK, PI3K/Akt, GSK-3{$\beta$}, and  NF-{$\kappa$}B pathways, thereby protecting cells from neuronal cell death.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (Family Eucommiaceae), also known as D\`u-zh\`ong (Chinese: ), Tuchong (in Japanese), is the sole species of  the genus Eucommia. The leaf, stem, and bark as well as staminate flower of  Eucommia ulmoides have been traditionally used to cure many diseases in China,  Japan, Korea, among others. The aim of this review is to comprehensively outline  the botanical description, ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, biological  activities, and toxicology of Eucommia ulmoides and to discuss possible trends  for further study of Eucommia ulmoides. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information on  Eucommia ulmoides was gathered via the internet (using Pub Med, Elsevier, Baidu  Scholar, Google Scholar, Medline Plus, ACS, CNKI, and Web of Science) and from  books in local libraries. RESULTS: One-hundred twelve compounds of Eucommia  ulmoides, including the main active constituents, lignans and iridoids, have been  isolated and identified. In vitro and in vivo studies indicated that monomer  compounds and extracts from Eucommia ulmoides possess wide-ranging  pharmacological actions, especially in treating hypertension, hyperlipemia,  diabetes, obesity, sexual dysfunction, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, aging,  lupus-like syndrome, and immunoregulation. CONCLUSIONS: Eucommia ulmoides has  been used as a source of traditional medicine and as a beneficial health food.  Phytochemical and pharmacological studies of Eucommia ulmoides have received much  interest, and extracts and active compounds continue to be isolated and proven to  exert various effects. Further toxicity and clinical studies are warranted to  establish more detailed data on crude extracts and pure compounds, enabling more  convenient preparations for patients. Therefore, this review on the  ethnopharmacology, phytochemistry, biological activities, and toxicity of  Eucommia ulmoides will provide helpful data for further studies as well as the  commercial exploitation of this traditional medicine.},

However, its functioning mechanism is still unknown. Thus it is  necessary to exploit the mechanism of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. METHODS: A systems  pharmacology approach combining drug-likeness evaluation, oral bioavailability  prediction, multiple drug targets prediction as well as network pharmacology  techniques has been used. RESULTS: This comprehensive systematic approach helps  successfully to identify 41 candidate compounds contained in Eucommia ulmoides  Oliv. while 39 potential targets hit by these ingredients and helps to uncover  the synergistic mechanism of action on a systematic level. CONCLUSIONS: Our work  successfully explains the mechanism of the efficiency of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.  for the treatment of hypertension and enhancing immune. These results not only  provide a new insight for the understanding of the chemical and pharmacological  basis of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., but also provide an efficient way for drug  discovery from herbal medicine.},

  abstract = {Regeneration is a common strategy for plants to survive the intrinsic and extrinsic challenges they face through their life cycle, and it may occur upon  wounding. Bark girdling is applied to improve fruit production or harvest bark as  medicinal material. When tree bark is removed, the cambium and phloem will be  peeled off. After a small strip of bark is removed from trees, newly formed  periderm and wound cambium develop from the callus on the surface of the trunk,  and new phloem is subsequently derived from the wound cambium. However, after  large-scale girdling, the newly formed sieve elements (SEs) appear earlier than  the regenerated cambium, and both of them derive from differentiating xylem cells  rather than from callus. This secondary vascular tissue regeneration mainly  involves three key stages: callus formation and xylem cell dedifferentiation; SEs  appearance and wound cambium formation. The new bark is formed within 1 month in  poplar, Eucommia; thus, it provides high temporal resolution of regenerated  tissues at different stages. In this review, we will illustrate the morphology,  gene expression and phytohormone regulation of vascular tissue regeneration after  large-scale girdling in trees, and also discuss the potential utilization of the  bark girdling system in studies of plant vascular development and tissue  regeneration.},

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study of 74 ICU patients in a tertiary hospital. Serum LPC, white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin (PCT) levels were measured at baseline (day 1 of enrollment) and day 7. The LPC concentrations were compared with inflammatory markers using their absolute levels and relative changes. RESULTS: The LPC concentration on day 7 was significantly lower in nonsurvivors than in survivors (68.45 {$\pm$} 42.36 {$\mu$}mol/L and 99.76 {$\pm$} 73.65 {$\mu$}mol/L; P = .04). A decreased LPC concentration on day 7 to its baseline as well as a sustained high concentration of PCT on day 7 at more than 50\% of its baseline value was useful for predicting the 28-day mortality. Prognostic utility was substantially improved when combined LPC and PCT criteria were applied to 28-day mortality outcome predictions. Furthermore, LPC concentrations increased over time in patients with appropriate antibiotics but not in those with inappropriate antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurements of LPC help in the prediction of 28-day mortality in ICU patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.},

Biliary secretion of bile acids generates bile flow and facilitates hepatobiliary secretion of lipids, lipophilic metabolites, and xenobiotics. In the intestine, bile acids are essential for the absorption, transport, and metabolism of dietary fats and lipid-soluble vitamins. Extensive research in the last 2 decades has unveiled new functions of bile acids as signaling molecules and metabolic integrators. The bile acid-activated nuclear receptors farnesoid X receptor, pregnane X receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, vitamin D receptor, and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor play critical roles in the regulation of lipid, glucose, and energy metabolism, inflammation, and drug metabolism and detoxification. Bile acid synthesis exhibits a strong diurnal rhythm, which is entrained by fasting and refeeding as well as nutrient status and plays an important role for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Recent research revealed an interaction of liver bile acids and gut microbiota in the regulation of liver metabolism. Circadian disturbance and altered gut microbiota contribute to the pathogenesis of liver diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and obesity. Bile acids and their derivatives are potential therapeutic agents for treating metabolic diseases of the liver.},

METHODS: The genetic  diversity of cultivated Eucommia ulmoides in Guizhou Province was analyzed by  phenotypic traits and start condon targeted polymorphism(SCoT)markers. RESULTS:  The phenotypic diversity index of the number of buds on neonatal branch was the  highest, which was 2.0638, and the number of blades on neonatal branch was the  lowest,which was 1.7084. By data obtained, 40 cultivated samples of Eucommia  ulmoides in Guizhou Province could be divided into 4 groups. A total of 76 bands  were produced by 10 primers, among which 50 bands were polymorphic bands, and the  percentage of polymorphic bands was 65.79\%. The average value of Nei's genetic  diversity index (H) was 0.1937, Shannon's information index (I) was 0.2832,  Genetic differentiation coefficient (Gst) was 0.1733, and the gene flow (Nm)  among populations was 2.3848. Cluster analysis based on genetic identity  indicated that 4 populations could be divided into 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Genetic  diversity of cultivated populations of Eucommia ulmoides in Guizhou Province had  little differences. The genetic differentiation within populations was bigger  than that among the populations. The high level of gene flow among populations  was beneficial to extension of Eucommia ulmoides. The phenotypic cluster was  similar to the SCoT cluster, the two classification results were significantly  correlated with geographic position,which can providing a good foundation for the  identification of Eucommia ulmoides germplasms.},

  abstract = {Oxidative stress-mediated cellular injury has been considered as a major cause of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases. The  scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediated by antioxidants may be a  potential strategy for retarding the disease's progression. Macranthoin G (MCG),  isolated from Eucommia ulmoides, is a derivative from chlorogenic acid methyl  ester and caffeic acid. This study is aimed to investigate the protective role of  MCG against the cytotoxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to elucidate  potential protective mechanisms in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The results  showed that the treatment of PC12 cells with MCG prior to H2O2 exposure  effectively increased the cell viability, and stabilized the mitochondria  membrane potential (MMP); furthermore, it enhanced the antioxidant enzyme  activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione  peroxidase (GSH-Px) and the levels of intracellular glutathione (GSH); it also  decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, intracellular ROS, caspase-3  activation, as well as cell apoptosis. In addition, the MCG treatment minimized  the cell injury by H2O2 via down-regulation of the NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway as well as  activation of phosphorylation of I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$}, p38, and the extracellular  signal-regulated kinase (ERK). These results showed that that MCG is promising as  a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases induced by oxidative  damage and should be encouraged for further research.},

The modern pharmacological research shows that  Eucommia ulmoides has many functions, such as anti-aging, antitumor and bone cell  proliferation. This paper studied the resin purification process optimization  conditions and antihypertensive effect of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The orthogonal experiment method was adopted to determine the  purification effect of various macro-porous resins for eucommia ulmoides Oliver,  and the SHR model was used to determine antihypertensive level of eucommia  ulmoides Oliver. RESULTS: The optimal process of resin extraction and  purification of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver was verified through the loading liquid  concentration at 6 mg/ml, 20\% ethanol used as the eluent; the flow rate control  was 3.0, column volume per hour and the diameter-height ratio of adsorption  column was 1:6; the extracts of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver can reduce SHR blood  pressure, its antihypertensive effect is relatively stable and has no significant  impact on HR, but the antihypertensive effect is lower than that of control  medicine captopril. Also, the extracts of eucommia ulmoides Oliver can  significantly increase the content of serum NO and reduce the content of ET.  CONCLUSION: The Eucommia ulmoides Oliver can relax blood vessels, reduce the  peripheral resistance, reduce the returned blood volume, and eventually achieve  the antihypertensive effect.},

The tea of male flowers of  EU has been become popularities and seen as aspirational health care tea in  China. There were no enough marks and effective method to control the quality of  male flowers of EU. OBJECTIVE: A simple and efficient HPLC method was developed  for the simultaneous determination of 11 bioactive compounds (4 iridoids, 1  phenylpropanoid, 6 flavonoids). HPLC chromatographic fingerprint and hierarchical  cluster analysis were used to evaluate and classify the samples of male flowers  of EU which came from different locations in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Samples were separated on a Thermal hypersil gold column (250 mm \texttimes{} 4.6 mm, 5 {$\mu$}m)  and detected by an ultraviolet detector. The UV wavelength was set at 206, 236,  and 206 nm. Mobile phase consisted of methanol (B) and phosphoric acid-water  (0.5\%) (C) using a gradient elution. Analytes were performed at 25\textdegree C with a flow  rate of 1.0 mL/min. RESULTS: In quantitative analysis, the eleven components  showed good regression (r(2) {$>$} 0.9996) within linear ranges, and their recoveries  were in the range of 98.65-102.31\%. In the chromatographic fingerprint, 16 peaks  were selected as the characteristic peaks to assess the similarities of different  samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was also applied to differentiate  the samples based on the area of all the common peaks. The samples which had  higher similarity in HPLC fingerprint were classified as a cluster. CONCLUSION:  This study will provide methodological reference for the quality control and  sample classification of male flowers of E. ulmoides.},

Duzhong is historically an active ingredient  commonly used in hypertensive herbal prescriptions in China. This work  investigated the vasodilating effect of Duzhong and its compounds (wogonin 10 {$\mu$}M  and oroxylin-A) in the isolated intact rat heart, perfused retrograde according  the method of Langendorff and the cytoprotective effect in EA.hy926 cell lines  Coronary perfusion pressure was monitored with a pressure transducer connected to  a side-arm of the aortic perfusion cannula. Duzhong induced vasorelaxation in a  dose dependent manner, on precontracting the vessels with endothelin-1, Duzhong  10 mg/ml, wogonin 10 {$\mu$}M and oroxylin-A 10 {$\mu$}M could significantly lower the  perfusion pressure in reference to positive control SNP, Duzhong induced  vasodilation was not inhibited by L-NAME (nitric oxide inhibitor), but was  significantly inhibited by Tetraethyl ammonium (TEA, a K(+) channel blocker and  almost abolished by potassium chloride. The underlying mechanism was carried out  in EA.hy926 cell lines. When these cells were treated with H2O2, there was higher  expression of NOX-4, TNF-{$\alpha$} and COX-2 mRNA. However, wogonin treatment attenuated  the mRNA of NOX-4, TNF-{$\alpha$} and COX-2. Wogonin also upregulated the mRNA expression  of CAT, SOD-1 and GSR in oxidative stress induced by H2O2 EA.hy926 cells. Duzhong  and compounds can exert an in vitro relaxation effect of the coronary artery and  improve the heart function in Langendorff apparatus. This action appears to be  endothelium dependent but not NO mediated. Cell culture findings indicated that  wogonin can exert vascular and cellular protection by scavenging Reactive Oxygen  Species.},

Recently, the  unsatisfactory pharmacotherapy and side effects of the drugs led to the  development of alternative medicine for treating these diseases. Du Zhong (DZ),  Eucommia ulmoides Oliver leaves, is a commonly used herb in the therapy of stroke  in China. We hypothesize that the components from DZ inhibit neuroinflammation.  In this study, DZ was extracted and the bioactive fractions with inhibitory  effect on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production in  BV-2 microglial cells were further separated using chromatography. Two purified  bioactive compounds, genipin (compound C) and  4-(1,2-dimethoxyethyl)benzene-1,2-diol (compound F), were isolated and identified  after spectroscopic analysis. The results showed that they inhibited  LPS-stimulated NO and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$}) production. Genipin  exerted its anti-inflammatory effects through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, whereas  compound F inhibited phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase  (MAPK). In conclusion, genipin and compound F have potential for developing into  new drugs for treating neurodegenerative diseases.},

Significant  positive correlations were found between progeny performances of growth traits  and genetic distances of parents based on sequence-related amplified polymorphism  markers or a combination of all 3 marker systems. This revealed that crosses  between genetically distant parents produced progenies with excellent growth  performances.

However, in the adipogenic  induction medium (AIM), the mRNA expression of PPARgamma, FABP4, C/EBPalpha and  LPL decreased with the 5-HMF treatment. Mineralized nodule formations were  enhanced after bMSCs were induced by 5-HMF for 14 and 21 days in normal medium.  In the AIM medium, 5-HMF not only inhibited the formation of adipose cells  obviously, but also stimulated the mineralized nodule formation after induced for  21 days. These results indicated that 5-HMF was a powerful inhibitor of  adipogenesis and enhancer of osteoblastogenesis.

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides leaves have been used as a functional food and drink in China. The purpose of this study was to identify the bioactive constituents with soluble  epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory activity and anti-inflammatory properties.  Twenty-seven known compounds (1-27) were isolated from the leaves of E. ulmoides  Oliver, and their structures were identified by NMR and ESIMS analysis; three of  these, 2,5-dimethoxy-3-glucopyranosyl cinnamic alcohol (11), foliasalacioside E2  (26), and icariside F2 (27), were obtained from this plant for the first time.  Compounds 1-7 exhibited soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitory activity at  100 {$\mu$}M; among them, quercetin (1) and kaempferol (5) displayed potential  activities with IC50 values of 22.5 {$\pm$} 0.9 and 31.3 {$\pm$} 2.6 {$\mu$}M, respectively, with  noncompetitive inhibition mode. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) inhibitory  activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated by the NF-{$\kappa$}B liciferase assay in  HepG2 cells. Compounds 1, 9, 20, and 27 displayed potent NF-{$\kappa$}B inhibitory  effects, with IC50 values of 15.14 {$\pm$} 2.29, 15.23 {$\pm$} 2.34, 16.88 {$\pm$} 2.17, and 16.25  {$\pm$} 2.19 {$\mu$}M, respectively, whereas other compounds showed weak inhibition of NF-{$\kappa$}B  transcriptional activity ranging from 17.54 to 92.6 {$\mu$}M. A structure-activity  relationship of flavonoids 1-9 was also discussed. The results obtained in this  work might contribute to the understanding of pharmacological activities of E.  ulmoides leaves and further investigation on its potential application values for  food and drug.},

High-resolution spectra were obtained with good reproducibility. From IR spectra,  some obvious differences in band frequency could be observed among Cortex  Eucommiae A-C. Curve fitting result indicated that polysaccharides' structures  and contents were different among Cortex Eucommiae A-C. To distinguish Cortex  Eucommiae from different producing areas, the A1245/A1328 ratio might be an  exceptionally practical factor. Additionally, FTIR microspectroscopy could  identify Cortex Eucommiae A-C with 89.5\% accuracy in combination with  hierarchical cluster analysis. The results suggest FTIR microspectroscopy is very  easy and efficient for distinguishing Cortex Eucommiae from different areas, and  also indicate FTIR microspectroscopy may be practical for TCM research.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The cortex and leaves of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. from the family Eucommiaceae are traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). Roasted  Eucommiae cortex is utilized to reinforce the muscles and lungs, lower blood  pressure and improve the tone of the liver and kidneys, while Eucommia ulmoides  leaves (EUL) are traditionally used as folk remedies to treat diabetes. MATERIALS  AND METHODS: EUL extract, obtained by ethanol (40\%) was loaded onto an AB-8  macroporous resin column, and washed thoroughly with 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80\% (v/v)  ethanol for purification. The ethanol eluents of EUL were first determined to  inhibit {$\alpha$}-glucosidase in vitro, and then the inhibition of the most potent  eluent, i.e., 20\% ethanol eluent of EUL (EEUL), against carbohydrate-degrading  enzymes and glucose transport in Caco-2 cells was demonstrated. And computational  modeling was also employed to evaluate the binding modes of compounds identified  in EEUL by GC-MS analysis. RESULTS: EEUL significantly inhibited {$\alpha$}-glucosidase  (43.08{$\pm$}0.55\%) competitively in vitro and concentration-dependently suppressed  sucrase (IC50, 0.07mg/mL) and maltase (IC50, 0.53mg/mL) in Caco-2 cells. The  inhibitory activity of EEUL (0.02mg/mL) on sucrase and maltase was identical to  that of acarbose (0.02mg/mL). Moreover, 1.0mg/mL EEUL decreased glucose transport  in cells by 26.25{$\pm$}0.86\%. GC-MS revealed that EEUL was rich in monosaccharides,  polyphenols and esters, which comprised 47.16\% of the total extract.  Computational modeling showed that catechin, {$\alpha$}-d-glucopyranose and  d-mannono-1,4-lactone docked tightly into the sucrase active site with low  binding energies. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that EEUL exerted marked  anti-hyperglycemic effects by suppressing disaccharidases and glucose  transporters. Therefore, EUL is a beneficial source of inhibitors of  carbohydrate-utilizing enzymes, glucose transporters, and potentially  hyperglycemia.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. bark (EU) is a common traditional Chinese herbal medicine for treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), but its  therapeutic effect on OA and the underlying mechanisms have not been fully  clarified. Our previous study showed that Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. bark aqueous  extract (EUE) had a protective effect on cartilage, and this study was aimed to  investigate the anti-osteoarthritis effect and mechanisms of EUE in a rat model  of osteoarthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two 5-week-old specific  pathogen-free Sprague-Dawley rats which were randomized into four even groups  (n=8). Group A received sham operation while the OA model was established using  the modified Hulth technique in groups B, C and D. For eight weeks after  operation, in addition to routine feeding, group A received gavage with deionized  water, group B with deionized water, group C with 1.35 g/kg/day EUE, and group D  with 2.7 g/kg/day EUE. Eight weeks postoperatively, all of the animals were  euthanized for radiological, gross and histopathological observations to evaluate  the effect of EUE on OA and to determine its potential mechanisms. RESULTS:  Radiological and histopathological observations showed that the articular  degenerative changes were significantly more alleviated in groups C and D than in  group B, while there were no obviously degenerative manifestations in group A.  Mankin׳s scores in groups C and D were significantly lower than in group B  (P{$<$}0.01). The severity of OA was significantly less in group D than in group C  (P{$<$}0.01). The IL-1{$\beta$} and IL-6 contents in serum and MMP-3 secretion in articular  cartilage were significantly lower in groups C and D than those in group B  (P{$<$}0.01), and significantly lower in group D than those in group C (P{$<$}0.01).  Compared with group B, phosphorylated Akt was significantly down-regulated in  groups C and D. CONCLUSIONS: EUE may inhibit the progression of osteoarthritis by  inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway to delay cartilage degeneration, reduce  inflammatory cytokines and prevent MMP-3 secretion. Therefore, EU is a potential  therapeutic agent for OA, but its efficacy is limited.},

In extracting the substances, the most important is the removal of the cuticle layer on the  leaves and the cell wall in the leaves of Eucommia ulmoides. But the removal of  the cuticle layer is a technical difficulty now. Cutinase (EC3.1.1.74) is a  multifunctional enzyme with a common alpha/beta fold structure belonging to  hydroplane that can make a substantial degradation of horny fatty acids. So this  study isolated bacteria capable of producing cutinase from the lesion of Eucommia  leaves and identified the bacteria. The identification using PCR-RFLP method  confirmed that the strain belongs to Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. The fermentation  conditions of the strain-producing cutinase were optimized in this study. The  finding of cutinase-producing R. mucilaginosa is significant because the yeast is  more secure than plant pathogens, being suitable for mass production.},

This study was performed to investigate the effects of E.\,ulmoides extract  on longitudinal bone growth rate, growth plate height, and the expressions of  bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in  adolescent female rats. In two groups, we administered a twice-daily dosage of  E.\,ulmoides extract (at 30 and 100\,mg/kg, respectively) per os over 4\,days, and  in a control group, we administered vehicle only under the same conditions.  Longitudinal bone growth rate in newly synthesized bone was observed using  tetracycline labeling. Chondrocyte proliferation in the growth plate was observed  using cresyl violet dye. In addition, we analyzed the expressions of BMP-2 and  IGF-1 using immunohistochemistry. Eucommia ulmoides extract significantly  increased longitudinal bone growth rate and growth plate height in adolescent  female rats. In the immunohistochemical study, E.\,ulmoides markedly increased  BMP-2 and IGF-1 expressions in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones. In  conclusion, E.\,ulmoides increased longitudinal bone growth rate by promoting  chondrogenesis in the growth plate and the levels of BMP-2 and IGF-1.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In spite of its great promise, metabolomics has proven difficult to execute in an untargeted and generalizable manner. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has made it possible to gather data on thousands of cellular metabolites. However, matching metabolites to their spectral features continues to be a bottleneck, meaning that much of the collected information remains uninterpreted and that new metabolites are seldom discovered in untargeted studies. These challenges require new approaches that consider compounds beyond those available in curated biochemistry databases. DESCRIPTION: Here we present Metabolic In silico Network Expansions (MINEs), an extension of known metabolite databases to include molecules that have not been observed, but are likely to occur based on known metabolites and common biochemical reactions. We utilize an algorithm called the Biochemical Network Integrated Computational Explorer (BNICE) and expert-curated reaction rules based on the Enzyme Commission classification system to propose the novel chemical structures and reactions that comprise MINE databases. Starting from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) COMPOUND database, the MINE contains over 571,000 compounds, of which 93\% are not present in the PubChem database. However, these MINE compounds have on average higher structural similarity to natural products than compounds from KEGG or PubChem. MINE databases were able to propose annotations for 98.6\% of a set of 667 MassBank spectra, 14\% more than KEGG alone and equivalent to PubChem while returning far fewer candidates per spectra than PubChem (46 vs. 1715 median candidates). Application of MINEs to LC-MS accurate mass data enabled the identity of an unknown peak to be confidently predicted. CONCLUSIONS: MINE databases are freely accessible for non-commercial use via user-friendly web-tools at http://minedatabase.mcs.anl.gov and developer-friendly APIs. MINEs improve metabolomics peak identification as compared to general chemical databases whose results include irrelevant synthetic compounds. Furthermore, MINEs complement and expand on previous in silico generated compound databases that focus on human metabolism. We are actively developing the database; future versions of this resource will incorporate transformation rules for spontaneous chemical reactions and more advanced filtering and prioritization of candidate structures. Graphical abstractMINE database construction and access methods. The process of constructing a MINE database from the curated source databases is depicted on the left. The methods for accessing the database are shown on the right.},

At the forefront of methodological innovation is an approach referred to as "untargeted" or "discovery" metabolomics. The experimental objective of this technique is to comprehensively measure the entire metabolome, which constitutes a largely undefined set of molecules. Given its potential comprehensive coverage, untargeted metabolomics is often the first choice of experiments for investigators pursuing a metabolic research question. It is important to recognize, however, that untargeted metabolomics may not always be the optimal experimental approach. Conventionally, untargeted metabolomics only provides information about relative differences in metabolite pool sizes. Therefore, depending on the specific scientific question at hand, a complementary approach involving stable isotopes (such as metabolic flux analysis) may be better suited to provide biological insights. Unlike untargeted metabolomics, stable-isotope methods can provide information about differences in reaction rates.},

METHODS:  Spontaneously hypertensive rats were divided into six groups as spontaneously  hypertensive control group (SHR), captopril group (25 mg/kg), Eucommia ulmoides  group (30 mg/kg), total flavonoids of Cydonia oblonga leaves low (40 mg/kg),  middle (80 mg/kg) and high dose (160 mg/kg) groups. Eight Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats  were given distilled water as the control. The drugs were given by intragastric  administration for 16 weeks, then the contents of IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-{$\alpha$} and  CRP in rats serum were detected. The weight and the blood pressure of rats were  measured at 0 min and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 weeks after drug administrated.  RESULTS: Compared with control group, the contents of IL-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, TNF-{$\alpha$} and CRP  were increased and IL-10 was decreased; Compared with SHR group, the contents of  IL-1{$\beta$},IL-6, TNF-{$\alpha$} and CRP were decreased in total flavonoids of Cydonia oblonga  leaves groups. CONCLUSION: Total flavonoids of Cydonia oblonga leaves show an  anti-hypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats and the mechanism  is related to the function of anti-inflammatory.},

Molecular breeding methods, such as marker-assisted selection  (MAS), have the potential to improve the efficiency of E. ulmoides breeding.  Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was applied to identify marker-trait  associations for E. ulmoides using an F1 mapping population of 152 individuals  derived from a cross between the wild genotype Xiaoye and the cultivar Qinzhong  No. 1. A total of 78 QTLs were identified for 12 leaf traits involving  morphology, yield, and secondary metabolites. Phenotypic variance explained by  individual QTLs ranged from 10.4 to 53.3\%. Fifteen QTL clusters, each harboring  loci controlling at least two leaf traits, were detected across nine linkage  groups. Co-location of these QTLs may be due to pleiotropy or linkage. Three main  QTL regions for secondary metabolites were consistently identified each year. QTL  information from this study furthers our understanding of the genetic  architecture of these economically important traits and of MAS in E. ulmoides  breeding.},

Bio-based methods might be a greener option for designing the PdNPs with  reduced environmental impacts. This study reports the synthesis of PdNPs by  utilising the aqueous extract of medicinally important Eucommia ulmoides (E.  Ulmoides) bark which functions as both reducing and capping agent in moderate  reaction conditions. Reduction potential of E. Ulmoides bark aqueous extract was  about -0.08 V vs. saturated calomel electrode by open-circuit voltage method and  the rich polyphenolics was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry, which helps to reduce  palladium ions to PdNPs. The characterisation through high-resolution  transmission electron microscopic, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray  diffraction infer that the as-synthesised PdNPs were spherical in shape with a  face cubic crystal structure. The results from dynamic light scattering suggest  the PdNPs have the narrow size distribution with an average size of 12.6 nm. The  lower zeta potential (-25.3 mV) and the Fourier transform infrared spectra  indicate that the as-synthesised PdNPs keep remarkably stable for a long period  due to the capped biomolecules on the nanoparticle surface. This method for  synthesis of PdNPs is simple, economic, non-toxic and efficient. The PdNPs show  excellent catalytic activity for the electro-catalytic oxidation of hydrazine and  the catalytic reducing degradation of p-aminoazobenzene, a model compound of  azo-dyes.},

However, the molecular mechanisms for the therapeutic benefits  remain largely unclear. The present study investigated the vasodilatory effect of  wogonin and its possible mechanisms. The flavonoid (0.1-100\,\textmu M) caused  concentration-dependent relaxations in endothelium-intact aortic rings  precontracted with norepinephrine (NE, 1\,\textmu M) or potassium chloride (KCl, 60\,mM).  Preincubation with wogonin (10, 100\,\textmu M) for 20\,min significantly inhibited the  contractile responses to NE (0.1, 1, 10\,\textmu M) or KCl (7.5, 15, 30, 60\,mM). Relaxant  responses to wogonin were not inhibited by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester  (100\,\textmu M) or endothelial denudation. In a Ca(2+)-free Krebs' solution, wogonin not  only blocked Ca(2+) influx-dependent vasoconstriction by either NE (1\,\textmu M) or KCl  (100\,mM), but also inhibited NE (1\,\textmu M)-induced tonic contraction, which is  dependent on intracellular Ca(2+) release. Wogonin also suppressed the elevation  of [Ca(2+)]i induced by KCl (60\,mM) after exhausting the calcium store in  sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticula with thapsigargin (1\,\textmu M) or by ATP (100\,\textmu M)  in primary vascular smooth muscle cells. These findings suggest that  wogonin-induced responses are mainly due to the inhibition of both intracellular  Ca(2+) release and extracellular Ca(2+) influx.},

Evaluation of genetic  diversity among some intraspecific hybrid populations of E. ulmoides Oliver is  vital for breeding programs and further conservation of this rare species. We  studied the genetic diversity of 130 accessions from 13 E. ulmoides intraspecific  hybrid populations using inter-simple sequence related (ISSR) and  sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. Of the 100 ISSR primers  and 100 SRAP primer combinations screened, eight ISSRs and eight SRAPs were used  to evaluate the level of polymorphism and discriminating capacity. A total number  of 65 bands were amplified using eight ISSR primers, in which 50 bands (76.9\%)  were polymorphic, with an average of 8.1 polymorphic fragments per primer.  Alternatively, another 244 bands were observed using eight SRAP primer  combinations, and 163 (66.8\%) of them were polymorphic, with an average of 30.5  polymorphic fragments per primer. The unweighted pair-group method (UPGMA)  analysis showed that these 13 populations could be classified into three groups  by the ISSR marker and two groups by the SRAP marker. Principal coordinate  analysis using SRAP was completely identical to the UPGMA-based clustering,  although this was partly confirmed by the results of UPGMA cluster analysis using  the ISSR marker. This study provides insights into the genetic background of E.  ulmoides intraspecific hybrids. The progenies of the variations "Huazhong-3",  "big fruit", "Yanci", and "smooth bark" present high genetic diversity and offer  great potential for E. ulmoides breeding and conservation.},

However, the pathological mechanism underlying the  protective effects of Eucommia lignans remains unknown. Cellular proliferation  was reported to contribute to important pathological changes in hypertensive  renal injuries, and increased angiotensin II (Ang II) expression was reported to  be essential for target-organ damage during hypertension. Ang II is the main  effective peptide in the renin-angiotensin system and is considered to be a key  mediator in the development of hypertensive nephropathy, R\"uster and Wolf (2011).  Our preliminary results showed that Eucommia lignans had inhibitory effects on  Ang II-induced proliferation of rat mesangial cells. In the present study, we  investigated the effects of Eucommia ulmoides on Ang II-induced proliferation and  apoptosis of rat mesangial cells. Cell cycle-related genes P21 and P27, and cell  apoptosis-related genes Bax and Bcl-2, were determined.},

The prepared MIPs were microspheres with a narrow particle size  distribution. Binding experiments and Scatchard analyses revealed that two  classes of binding sites, high and low affinity sites, were formed on the MIP.  The retention and molecular-recognition properties of the prepared MIP were  evaluated using a mixture of water and acetonitrile as a mobile phase in  hydrophilic interaction chromatography. With an increase of acetonitrile content,  the retention factor of CGA was increased on the MIP. In addition to shape  recognition, hydrophilic interactions seem to work for the recognition of CGA on  the MIP. The MIP had a specific molecular-recognition ability for CGA, while  other related compounds, such as caffeic acid, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid  and vanillic acid, could not be recognized by the MIP. Furthermore, the MIP for  CGA was successfully applied for extraction of CGA in the leaves of Eucommia  ulmodies.},

The hydration of mice dorsal skin decreased  significantly with repeated UV irradiation, but did not decrease when the herb  extract was administered for seven weeks. Transepidermal water loss (TEWL)  increased with UV irradiation, but decreased with the administration of dietary  herb extract. These effects were more pronounced when combined with the  administration of collagen hydrolysate. Geniposidic acid from E. ulmoides leaves  and ginsenoside Rg1 from Korean ginseng reduced TEWL and increased the skin  moisture content of UV-damaged skin on hairless mice, respectively.

The purpose of this study was to investigate potential in vivo  protective effects of Duzhong against  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), as well as the bioactive  constituents against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) toxicity in vitro.  METHODS: Male C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally administrated five consecutive  injections of MPTP every 24 h at a dose of 30 mg/kg to induce an in vivo PD  model. Pole and traction tests were performed in mice to evaluate motor deficits  and bradykinesia after the final MPTP administration. The striatal levels of  dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanilic  acid, were measured using a High-performance liquid chromatography-electrical  conductivity detector. To further explore the bioactive constituents and  protective mechanisms of Duzhong, seven compounds from Duzhong were tested on  MPP(+)-treated SH-SY5Y cell lines in vitro. A proteasome enzymatic assay and Cell  Counting Kit-8 were performed to examine proteasomal activity and cell viability  of Duzhong-treated cells, respectively, after exposure to MPP(+) and proteasome  inhibitor MG132. RESULTS: Duzhong antagonized the loss of striatal  neurotransmitters and relieved the associated anomaly in ambulatory locomotor  activity in PD mice after a 3-day pre-treatment of Duzhong crude extract. The  five Duzhong compounds attenuated MPP(+)-induced dysfunction of protease activity  and reduced MG132-induced cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: Duzhong could serve as a  potential candidate for PD treatment, and its mechanism involves the amelioration  of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eucommiae cortex (EC), the bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., has been traditionally used to treat many diseases in China for  more than 2000 years. The pharmacological effects are primarily attributed to the  presence of lignans, iridoids and phenolics, which are main active ingredients in  EC. AIM OF THE STUDY: First, to investigate the active ingredients that can be  absorbed into the rat plasma according to which ingredients exhibit significant  correlation of drug concentration-time curve. Second, to establish an efficient  ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS)  method for simultaneous determination of ingredients absorbed in rat plasma.  Finally, to investigate gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of the ingredients  absorbed in male and female rats plasma after oral administration with EC  extract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 18 ingredients from EC were detected by  UPLC-MS/MS, 9 out of 18 ingredients were absorbed into rat plasma. And 5  ingredients exhibit significant correlation of drug concentration-time curve.  They were pinoresinol di-O-{$\beta$}-d-glucopyranoside (PDG), geniposide (GE),  geniposidic acid (GA), aucubin (AN) and chlorogenic acid (CA). The analytes were  extracted from rat plasma via a simple protein precipitation procedure and  osalmid was used as the internal standard. Chromatographic separation was  achieved on a Waters ACQUITY HSS T3 column (2.1mm\texttimes 100mm, 1.8{$\mu$}m) using a gradient  elution program with acetonitrile and 0.1\% formic acid water as the mobile phase,  with a flow rate of 0.3mLmin(-1). The detection was performed on a  triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reactions monitoring (MRM)  mode in a positive ion mode via electrospray ionization (ESI). The transition  monitored were /z 683.00[M+H](+)\textrightarrow 235.10 for PDG, / z 389.00[M+H](+)\textrightarrow 208.80 for  GE, m/z 375.00[M+H](+)\textrightarrow 194.79 for GA, m/z 364.00[M+NH4](+)\textrightarrow 148.81 for AN, m/z  355.10[M+H](+)\textrightarrow 162.84 for CA and m/z 230.03[M+H](+)\textrightarrow 120.77 for internal standard.  RESULTS: The developed method showed good linearity over a wide concentration  range, the lower limits of quantification and higher accuracy and precision for  determination of the 5 analytes. Then the method was applied to study the  pharmacokinetics in rats, and the results indicated that there were significant  differences in pharmacokinetic parameters of the analytes between the male and  female rats, and absorptions of these analytes in male group were all  significantly higher than those in female group. CONCLUSION: This study  established an efficient, sensitive and selective UPLC-MS/MS method for  simultaneous determination of the five ingredients in rat plasma, and it could be  successfully applied to the comparative pharmacokinetic studies in male and  female rats after oral administration with EC extract.},

Using inter-simple sequence repeat  (ISSR) and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers, we studied the  genetic diversity and population genetic structure of 187 accessions from 17 E.  ulmoides populations throughout its main distribution in China. A total of 65  bands were amplified using eight ISSR primers, of which 50 bands (76.9\%) were  polymorphic. Meanwhile, another 244 bands were observed using eight SRAP primer  combinations and 163 (66.8\%) of these were polymorphic. The analysis of molecular  variation (AMOVA) indicated that 88.8 and 92.4\% of the total variation resided  within populations based on ISSR and SRAP analysis, respectively. Moreover, we  found that the E. ulmoides populations were clustered into six distinct groups  using ISSR and SRAP markers via the unweighted pair-group method (UPGMA).  Furthermore, STRUCTURE analysis showed that these 17 populations could be  classified into four groups using ISSR markers, but only two groups using SRAP  markers. No significant relevancy was observed between genetic and geographic  distances among the sampled populations. The results of this study support the  view that exchange of seeds among local farmers plays an important role in  shaping the present genetic distribution pattern. "Core collection" is suggested  for genetic diversity conservation of E. ulmoides in China.},

METHODS: Fifty-four axuSpA patients of  Shen-deficiency Du-channel cold syndrome (SDDCS) in line with inclusive criteria  were recruited and assigned to the treatment group and the control group  according to random digit table, 27 in each group. Patients in the control group  took Celecoxib Capsule (0.2 g each time, twice per day). Patients in the  treatment group additionally took QR (consisting of Herba Epimedii 15 g, antler  glue 15 g, Cibotium Barometz 15 g, eucommia bark 20 g, dipsacus asper 10 g, two  toothed achyranthes root 15 g, drynaria 15 g, Taxillus Chinensis 20 g, ground  beetle 10 g, scorpion 5 g, wild celery 10 g, notopterygium incisium 10 g, cow-fat  seed 10 g, white mustard seed 6 g, and licorice root 6 g, one dose per day, twice  daily). The therapeutic course for all was 4 weeks. The Bath Ankylosing  Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis  Functional Index (BASFI), the Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI), total body pain  and spinal pain, patient and physician global assessment on a four-point scale,  the Ankylosing Spondylitis Quality of Life (ASQoL), erythrocyte sedimentation  rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured before and after 4 weeks of  treatment. The primary end point in this study was the proportion of patients  with a 20\%improvement response accord- ing to the ASAS International Working  Group Criteria (ASAS 20 responders) at week 4. RESULTS: Totally 50 patients  completed this trial, 26 in the treatment group and 24 in the control group.  Improvement of BASDAI, BASFI, BASMI, ASQoL, ESR, and CRP was shown in both groups  after treatment. Better effect was shown in the treatment group in all indices  except ESR and BASMI after treatment (P {$<$} 0.05, P {$<$} 0.01). Twenty cases  (accounting for 76.92\%) in the treatment group achieved ASAS 20 response at week  4, while 12 cases (accounting for 50.00\%) in the control group achieved ASAS 20  response at week 4 (P {$<$} 0.05). No obvious adverse reaction occurred in the two  groups. CONCLUSION: QR combined Celecoxib Capsule showed better effect in  treating axuSpA patients than using Celecoxib Capsule alone.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eucommia bark, Eucommia ulmoides Oliver barks (Du-Zhong in Mandarin), is an herb used for renal dysfunction in Chinese traditional medicine. In an  attempt to develop this herb as a treatment for diabetic nephropathy (DN), we  investigated the effects of Du-Zhong on renal dysfunction in type 1-like diabetic  rats. METHODS: Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce type 1-like diabetes in  rats (STZ-diabetic rats). In addition to hyperglycemia, STZ-diabetic rats showed  significant nephropathy, including higher plasma levels of blood urea nitrogen,  creatinine, and renal fibrosis. Western blot analysis of renal cortical tissue  was applied to characterize the changes in potential signals related to  nephropathy. RESULTS: Oral administration of Du-Zhong (1 g/kg/day) to  STZ-diabetic rats for 20 days not only decreased the plasma levels of blood urea  nitrogen and creatinine but also improved renal fibrosis, whereas the plasma  glucose level was not changed. The higher expressions of protein levels of  transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-{$\beta$}) and connective tissue growth factor in  diabetic rats were markedly attenuated by Du-Zhong. The increased phosphorylation  of Smad2/3 in STZ-diabetic rats was also reduced by Du-Zhong. However, Du-Zhong  cannot reverse the hyperglycemia-induced overproduction of signal transducers and  activators of transcription 3 in the diabetic kidney. CONCLUSION: Oral  administration of Du-Zhong improves STZ-induced DN in rats by inhibiting  TGF-{$\beta$}/Smad signaling and suppressing TGF-{$\beta$}/connective tissue growth factor  expression. Therefore, active principle from Du-Zhong is suitable to develop as  new agent for DN in the future.},

Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is an important compound in E. ulmoides with  neuroprotective, cognition improvement and other pharmacological effects.  However, it is unknown whether chlorogenic acid-enriched Eucommia ulmoides Oliver  bark has antidepressant potential through neuron protection, serotonin release  promotion and penetration of blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In the present  study, we demonstrated that CGA could stimulate axon and dendrite growth and  promote serotonin release through enhancing synapsin I expression in the cells of  fetal rat raphe neurons in vitro. More importantly, CGA-enriched extract of E.  ulmoides (EUWE) at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day orally administered for 7 days showed  antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test of KM mice. Furthermore,  we also found CGA could be detected in the the cerebrospinal fluid of the rats  orally treated with EUWE and reach the level of pharmacological effect for  neuroprotection by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The findings indicate CGA is able to cross  the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier to exhibit its neuron protection and  promotion of serotonin release through enhancing synapsin I expression. This is  the first report of the effect of CGA on promoting 5-HT release through enhancing  synapsin I expression and CGA-enriched EUWE has antidepressant-like effect in  vivo. EUWE may be developed as the natural drugs for the treatment of depression.},

Moreover, lignans exerts neuroprotective effect  on glaucoma-associated optic neuropathy in glaucomatous rats. Lignans treatment  could improve oxidative stress response in RGCs and retinas of glaucomatous rats.  Lignans plays an anti-oxidative stress role via the activation of AMPK signaling.

The use of MAM as the co-monomer resulted in the  formation of microsphere MIPs and non-imprinted polymers (NIPs) with ca. 3- and  5-{$\mu$}m particle diameters, respectively. Binding experiments and Scatchard analyses  revealed that the binding capacity and affinity of the MIP to CA are higher than  those of the NIP. The retention and molecular-recognition properties of the  prepared MIPs were evaluated using water-acetonitrile and sodium phosphate  buffer-acetonitrile as mobile phases in hydrophilic interaction chromatography  (HILIC) and reversed-phase chromatography, respectively. In HILIC mode, the MIP  showed higher molecular-recognition ability for CA than in reversed-phase mode.  In addition to shape recognition, hydrophilic interactions seem to work for the  recognition of CA on the MIP in HILIC mode, while hydrogen bonding and  hydrophobic interactions seem to work for the recognition of CA in reversed-phase  mode. The MIP had a specific molecular-recognition ability for CA in HILIC mode,  while other structurally related compounds, such as chlorogenic acid （CGA),  gallic acid, protocatechuic acid and vanillic acid, could not be recognized by  the MIP. Furthermore, the MIP was successfully applied for extraction of CA and  CGA in the leaves of Eucommia ulmodies in HILIC mode.},

Objective This study investigates the protective effects  of DZW in ovariectomy (OVX)-induced bone loss in a rat osteopenia model.  Materials and methods Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the  sham-operated group (SHAM) and five OVX subgroups: OVX with vehicle (OVX),  17{$\beta$}-estradiol (E2) and with three graded doses of DZW. Daily oral administration  of the different samples started on the fifth week and lasted for 12 weeks,  respectively. The body weight, uterus wet weight, serum biochemical parameters,  bone mineral density (BMD), bone biomechanical properties, bone microarchitecture  and immunohistochemistry were examined. Results Compared with the SHAM group, the  DZW treatment significantly reversed the osteoporotic changes in OVX rats. The  DZW-H group showed that serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b)  levels reduced by 152.25\% (p\,{$<$}\,0.01) and osteocalein (OCN) levels dose  dependently increased by 118.43\% (p\,{$<$}\,0.01) as compared with the OVX group.  Compared with the OVX group, the DZW at different three dosages of DZW evidently  increased the right femur BMD by 112.43, 114.56 and 116.45\%, and dramatically  promoted bone quality and bone strength (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Further, immunohistochemical  evaluation also showed that DZW administration increased ER expression in uteri  (p\,{$<$}\,0.01). Conclusions DZW exhibits an anti-osteoporotic effect, probably  mediated via phyto-estrogenic effects. It might be a potential herbal alternative  for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.},

For this purpose, the solubility of CGA and the activity of cellulase were  investigated in eight 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium ionic liquids. Cellulase in  0.5~M [C6mim]Br aqueous solution was found to provide better performance in  extraction. The factors of ILEAE procedures including extraction time, extraction  phase pH, extraction temperatures and enzyme concentrations were investigated.  Moreover, the novel developed approach offered advantages in term of yield and  efficiency compared with other conventional extraction techniques. Scanning  electronic microscopy of plant samples indicated that cellulase treated cell wall  in ionic liquid solution was subjected to extract, which led to more efficient  extraction by reducing mass transfer barrier. The proposed ILEAE method would  develope a continuous process for enzyme-assisted extraction including enzyme  incubation and solvent extraction process. In this research, we propose a novel  view for enzyme-assisted extraction of plant active component, besides  concentrating on enzyme facilitated cell wall degradation, focusing on  improvement of bad permeability of ionic liquids solutions.},

Separation of the active ingredients was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC\textregistered{}  BEH C18 column (2.1 \texttimes ~50~mm; internal diameter 1.7~\textmu m) at a flow rate of  0.35~mL/min, with acetonitrile/water containing 0.1~\% formic acid as the mobile  phase. Detection was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer  via electrospray ionization source with positive and negative ionization modes.  All calibration curves showed good linearity (r~{$\geq~$}0.997) over the concentration  range with the low limit of quantification between 4.45 and 54.9~ng/mL. Precision  was evaluated by intra- and inter-day assays, and the percentages of the relative  standard deviation were all within 15~\%. Extraction efficiency and matrix effect  were 84.3-102.4~\% and 98.1-112.2~\%, respectively. The validated method was  successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study in rats after oral  administration of E. ulmoides extract. The results indicate that the  pharmacokinetic properties of GA differ from those of PCA, CA, PDG and PG,  respectively.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (Eucommiaceae) leaf exhibits beneficial lipid-lowering and anti-obesity effects. However, the mechanisms remain unknown.  OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the lipid-lowering  effects of chlorogenic acid (CGA)-enriched extract from this plant (CAEF) in  human hepatoma HepG2 cells, focusing on cholesterol metabolism. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: HepG2 cells were treated with CAEF (10, 20, 25, 40, 60, and 80\,mg/L),  CGA (0.3, 3, 30, 300, and 600\,{$\mu$}mol/L), and simvastatin (0.1, 1, 10, 50, and  100\,{$\mu$}mol/L) for 24 or 48\,h. The cytotoxicity, Oil red O staining, total  cholesterol, and triacylglycerol in supernatants were determined. The mRNA  expression of genes involved in cholesterol metabolism was determined with  RT-PCR. The protein expression of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) was examined by  immunocytochemistry and western-blot. RESULTS: The IC50 values were 59.2\,mg/L for  CAEF, 335.9\,{$\mu$}mol/L for CGA, and 10.5\,{$\mu$}mol/L for simvastatin. By treating cells  with CAEF (25\,mg/L), CGA (30\,{$\mu$}mol/L), or simvastatin (10\,{$\mu$}mol/L) for 48\,h, the  efflux of total cholesterol and triacylglycerol was increased (CAEF, 4.06- and  31.00-folds; CGA, 2.94- and 2.17-folds; and simvastatin, 3.94- and 24.67-folds),  and the cellular lipid droplets were reduced in Oil red O staining. CAEF and CGA  increased mRNA expression of ABCA1, CYP7A1, and AMPK{$\alpha$}2, while CAEF and  simvastatin decreased SREBP2. However, their effects on LXR{$\alpha$} mRNA expression were  variable. Importantly, all drugs significantly inhibited protein expression of  HMGCR at mRNA and protein levels. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: CAEF is a promising  dietary supplement to prevent obesity and dyslipidemia and the effects appear to  be due, at least in part, to regulating cholesterol metabolism through inhibition  of HMGCR in HepG2 cells.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The in silico fragmenter MetFrag, launched in 2010, was one of the first approaches combining compound database searching and fragmentation prediction for small molecule identification from tandem mass spectrometry data. Since then many new approaches have evolved, as has MetFrag itself. This article details the latest developments to MetFrag and its use in small molecule identification since the original publication. RESULTS: MetFrag has gone through algorithmic and scoring refinements. New features include the retrieval of reference, data source and patent information via ChemSpider and PubChem web services, as well as InChIKey filtering to reduce candidate redundancy due to stereoisomerism. Candidates can be filtered or scored differently based on criteria like occurence of certain elements and/or substructures prior to fragmentation, or presence in so-called "suspect lists". Retention time information can now be calculated either within MetFrag with a sufficient amount of user-provided retention times, or incorporated separately as "user-defined scores" to be included in candidate ranking. The changes to MetFrag were evaluated on the original dataset as well as a dataset of 473 merged high resolution tandem mass spectra (HR-MS/MS) and compared with another open source in silico fragmenter, CFM-ID. Using HR-MS/MS information only, MetFrag2.2 and CFM-ID had 30~and 43~Top 1 ranks, respectively, using PubChem as a database. Including reference and retention information in MetFrag2.2 improved this to 420 and 336 Top~1 ranks with ChemSpider and PubChem (89 and 71~\%), respectively, and even up to 343~Top 1 ranks (PubChem) when combining with CFM-ID. The optimal parameters and weights were verified using three additional datasets of 824 merged HR-MS/MS spectra in total. Further examples are given to demonstrate flexibility of the enhanced features. CONCLUSIONS: In many cases additional information is available from the experimental context to add to small molecule identification, which is especially useful where the mass spectrum alone is not sufficient for candidate selection from a large number of candidates. The results achieved with MetFrag2.2 clearly show the benefit of considering this additional information. The new functions greatly enhance the chance of identification success and have been incorporated into a command line interface in a flexible way designed to be integrated into high throughput workflows. Feedback on the command line version of MetFrag2.2 available at http://c-ruttkies.github.io/MetFrag/ is welcome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scientists have long been driven by the desire to describe, organize, classify, and compare objects using taxonomies and/or ontologies. In contrast to  biology, geology, and many other scientific disciplines, the world of chemistry  still lacks a standardized chemical ontology or taxonomy. Several attempts at  chemical classification have been made; but they have mostly been limited to  either manual, or semi-automated proof-of-principle applications. This is  regrettable as comprehensive chemical classification and description tools could  not only improve our understanding of chemistry but also improve the linkage  between chemistry and many other fields. For instance, the chemical  classification of a compound could help predict its metabolic fate in humans, its  druggability or potential hazards associated with it, among others. However, the  sheer number (tens of millions of compounds) and complexity of chemical  structures is such that any manual classification effort would prove to be near  impossible. RESULTS: We have developed a comprehensive, flexible, and computable,  purely structure-based chemical taxonomy (ChemOnt), along with a computer program  (ClassyFire) that uses only chemical structures and structural features to  automatically assign all known chemical compounds to a taxonomy consisting of  {$>$}4800 different categories. This new chemical taxonomy consists of up to 11  different levels (Kingdom, SuperClass, Class, SubClass, etc.) with each of the  categories defined by unambiguous, computable structural rules. Furthermore each  category is named using a consensus-based nomenclature and described (in English)  based on the characteristic common structural properties of the compounds it  contains. The ClassyFire webserver is freely accessible at  http://classyfire.wishartlab.com/. Moreover, a Ruby API version is available at  https://bitbucket.org/wishartlab/classyfire\_api, which provides programmatic  access to the ClassyFire server and database. ClassyFire has been used to  annotate over 77 million compounds and has already been integrated into other  software packages to automatically generate textual descriptions for, and/or  infer biological properties of over 100,000 compounds. Additional examples and  applications are provided in this paper. CONCLUSION: ClassyFire, in combination  with ChemOnt (ClassyFire's comprehensive chemical taxonomy), now allows chemists  and cheminformaticians to perform large-scale, rapid and automated chemical  classification. Moreover, a freely accessible API allows easy access to more than  77 million "ClassyFire" classified compounds. The results can be used to help  annotate well studied, as well as lesser-known compounds. In addition, these  chemical classifications can be used as input for data integration, and many  other cheminformatics-related tasks.},

Through genome-wide analyses we detected a transcriptional response to type I interferons (IFN-Is) in astrocytes during experimental CNS autoimmunity and also in CNS lesions from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). IFN-I signaling in astrocytes reduces inflammation and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) disease scores via the ligand-activated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and the suppressor of cytokine signaling 2 (SOCS2). The anti-inflammatory effects of nasally administered interferon (IFN)-{$\beta$} are partly mediated by AHR. Dietary tryptophan is metabolized by the gut microbiota into AHR agonists that have an effect on astrocytes to limit CNS inflammation. EAE scores were increased following ampicillin treatment during the recovery phase, and CNS inflammation was reduced in antibiotic-treated mice by supplementation with the tryptophan metabolites indole, indoxyl-3-sulfate, indole-3-propionic acid and indole-3-aldehyde, or the bacterial enzyme tryptophanase. In individuals with MS, the circulating levels of AHR agonists were decreased. These findings suggest that IFN-Is produced in the CNS function in combination with metabolites derived from dietary tryptophan by the gut flora to activate AHR signaling in astrocytes and suppress CNS inflammation.},

LPC species were quantified by direct flow-injection electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in serum of 45 patients with mainly alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC is 52.1 (31.7-110.0) {$\mu$}mol/l in serum of patients with CHILD-PUGH score C (decompensated liver cirrhosis) and significantly lower compared to patients with well-compensated disease (CHILD-PUGH score A) with 114.1 (12.3-401.4) {$\mu$}mol/l. Mono- and polyunsaturated LPC are not changed in these groups. Saturated LPC is negatively correlated with the model for end-stage liver disease score, bilirubin and galectin-3 and positively with Quick prothrombin time. Ascites and varices are complications of liver cirrhosis. Saturated LPC does, however, not correlate with hepatic venous pressure gradient, ascites volume and variceal size. Unexpectedly, saturated LPC measured in serum of 42 patients declines from 88.4 (27.8-177.5) {$\mu$}mol/l to 72.4 (27.6-141.8) {$\mu$}mol/l shortly after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt implantation.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pathogenesis and diagnostic biomarkers for diseases can be discovered by metabolomic profiling of human fluids. If the various types of coronary artery disease (CAD) can be accurately characterized by metabolomics, effective treatment may be targeted without using unnecessary therapies and resources. OBJECTIVES The authors studied disturbed metabolic pathways to assess the diagnostic value of metabolomics-based biomarkers in different types of CAD. METHODS A cohort of 2,324 patients from 4 independent centers was studied. Patients underwent coronary angiography for suspected CAD. Groups were divided as follows: normal coronary artery (NCA), nonobstructive coronary atherosclerosis (NOCA), stable angina (SA), unstable angina (UA), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Plasma metabolomic profiles were determined by liquid chromatography\textendash quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and were analyzed by multivariate statistics. RESULTS We made 12 cross-comparisons to and within CAD to characterize metabolic disturbances. We focused on comparisons of NOCA versus NCA, SA versus NOCA, UA versus SA, and AMI versus UA. Other comparisons were made, including SA versus NCA, UA versus NCA, AMI versus NCA, UA versus NOCA, AMI versus NOCA, AMI versus SA, significant CAD (SA/UA/AMI) versus nonsignificant CAD (NCA/NOCA), and acute coronary syndrome (UA/AMI) versus SA. A total of 89 differential metabolites were identified. The altered metabolic pathways included reduced phospholipid catabolism, increased amino acid metabolism, increased short-chain acylcarnitines, decrease in tricarboxylic acid cycle, and less biosynthesis of primary bile acid. For differential diagnosis, 12 panels of specific metabolomics-based biomarkers provided areas under the curve of 0.938 to 0.996 in the discovery phase (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1,086), predictive values of 89.2\% to 96.0\% in the test phase (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 933), and 85.3\% to 96.4\% in the 3-center external sets (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 305). CONCLUSIONS Plasma metabolomics are powerful for characterizing metabolic disturbances. Differences in small-molecule metabolites may reflect underlying CAD and serve as biomarkers for CAD progression.

  abstract = {Atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Deposition of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is  one of the initiators and promoters of atherosclerosis. Eucommia lignans were  shown to possess antihypertensive effects. This study aimed to investigate the  effects of pinoresinol diglucoside (PD), a Eucommia lignan, on oxLDL-induced  endothelial dysfunction. HUVECs were treated with oxLDL and/or PD followed by  assessing radical oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis, nitrogen oxide (NO),  malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity with specific  assays kits, mRNA levels with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction  (PCR), and protein levels with western blot. PD abolished oxLDL-induced ROS and  MDA production, apoptosis, upregulation of lectin-like oxidized LDL recptor-1  (LOX-1), intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and nuclear factor  kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-{$\kappa$}B), and activation of  p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinases)/NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling. Meanwhile, PD  alleviated oxLDL-caused inhibition of SOD activity, eNOS expression, and NO  production. These data demonstrated that PD was effective in protecting  endothelial cells from oxLDL-caused injuries, which guarantees further  investigation on the clinical benefits of PD on cardiovascular diseases.},

  abstract = {Cortex Eucommiae is used worldwide in traditional medicine, various constituents of Cortex Eucommiae, such as chlorogenic acid (CGA), has been reported to exert  anti-osteoporosis activity in China, but the mechanism about their contribution  to the overall activity is limited. The aims of this study were to determine  whether chlorogenic acid can prevent estrogen deficiency-induced osteoporosis and  to analyze the mechanism of CGA bioactivity. The effect of CGA on estrogen  deficiency-induced osteoporosis was performed in vivo. Sixty female  Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly among a sham-operated group and five  ovariectomy (OVX) plus treatment subgroups: saline vehicle, 17{$\alpha$}-ethinylestradiol  (E2), or CGA at 9, 27, or 45 mg/kg/d. The rats' femoral metaphyses were evaluated  by micro-computed tomography ({$\mu$}CT). The mechanism of CGA bioactivity was  investigated in vitro. Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were treated with CGA,  with or without phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. BMSCs  proliferation and osteoblast differentiation were assessed with  3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and  alkaline phosphatase, with or without Shp2 interfering RNA (RNAi). The results  display that CGA at 27 and 45 mg/kg/day inhibited the decrease of bone mineral  density (BMD) that induced by OVX in femur (p{$<$} 0.01), significantly promoted the  levels of bone turnover markers, and prevented bone volume fraction (BV/TV),  connectivity density (CoonD), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness  (Tb.Th) (all p{$<$} 0.01) to decrease and prevented the trabecular separation  (Tb.Sp), structure model index (SMI)(both p{$<$} 0.01) to increase. CGA at 1 or 10 {$\mu$}M  enhanced BMSC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. CGA at 0.1 to 10 {$\mu$}M  increased phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and cyclin D1. These effects were reversed  by LY294002. CGA at 1 or 10 {$\mu$}M increased BMSC differentiation to osteoblasts (p{$<$}  0.01), Shp2 RNAi suppressed CGA-induced osteoblast differentiation by decreasing  Shp2, p-Akt, and cyclin D1. This study found that CGA improved the BMD and  trabecular micro-architecture for the OVX-induced osteoporosis. Therefore, CGA  might be an effective alternative treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis. CGA  promoted proliferation of osteoblast precursors and osteoblastic differentiation  of BMSCs via the Shp2/PI3K/Akt/cyclin D1 pathway.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a group of endogenous small non-coding RNAs, play important roles in plant growth, development, and stress response processes. Eucommia  ulmoides Oliver (hardy rubber tree) is one of the few woody plants capable of  producing trans-1, 4-polyisoprene (TPI), also known as Eu-rubber, which has been  utilized as an industrial raw material and is extensively cultivated in China.  However, the mechanism of TPI biosynthesis has not been identified in E.  ulmoides. To characterize small RNAs and their targets with potential biological  roles involved in the TPI biosynthesis in E. ulmoides, in the present study,  eight small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced from young and mature  leaves and fruits of E. ulmoides. Further analysis identified 34 conserved miRNAs  belonging to 20 families (two unclassified families), and 115 novel miRNAs seemed  to be specific to E. ulmoides. Among these miRNAs, fourteen conserved miRNAs and  49 novel miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed and identified as  Eu-rubber accumulation related miRNAs. Based on the E. ulmoides genomic data, 202  and 306 potential target genes were predicted for 33 conserved and 92 novel  miRNAs, respectively; the predicted targets are mostly transcription factors and  functional genes, which were enriched in metabolic pathways and biosynthesis of  secondary metabolites. Noticeably, based on the expression patterns of miRNAs and  their target genes in combination with the Eu-rubber accumulation, the negative  correlation of expression of six miRNAs (Eu-miR14, Eu-miR91, miR162a, miR166a,  miR172c, and miR396a) and their predicted targets serving as potential regulators  in Eu-rubber accumulation. This study is the first to detect conserved and novel  miRNAs and their potential targets in E. ulmoides and identify several candidate  genes potentially controlling rubber accumulation, and thus provide molecular  evidence for understanding the roles of miRNAs in regulating the TPI biosynthesis  in E. ulmoides.},

The leaves of Eucommia  ulmoides O., also referred to as Tu-chung or Du-zhong, have been used for the  treatment of hypertension and diabetes, showing great antioxidant activity and  anti-glycation activity. Lignans is one of the main bioactive components of  Eucommia ulmoides. This study mainly investigated the effect of lignans treatment  on AGEs-induced endothelium damage. METHODS: MTT assay, Hoechst staining, and  calcein-AM/ propidium iodide (PI) staining was conducted to determine the effect  of lignans treatment on endothelial cell function in vitro. Retinal trypsin  digestion, Evans blue assay, isolectin staining, and western blots were conducted  to determine the effect of lignans treatment on retinal microvascular function in  vivo. Western blot, protein immunoprecipitation (IP), MTT assays, and enzyme  activity assay was conducted to detect the effect of ligans treatment on  oxidative stress response. RESULTS: Lignans protected retinal endothelial cell  against AGEs-induced injury in vitro and diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction in  vivo. Lignans treatment could regulate oxidative stress response in retinal  endothelial cell line, retina, and liver. Moreover, we showed that NRF2/HO-1  signaling was critical for lignans-mediated oxidative stress regulation.  CONCLUSION: Lignans treatment could protect against endothelial dysfunction in  vivo and in vitro via regulating Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Lignans might be developed  as a promising drug for the treatment of diabetes-induced microvascular  dysfunction.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., a valuable Chinese herb, has shown a variety of health benefits. Despite the widespread clinical use of  this herb to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Traditional Chinese Medicine  (TCM), very few studies have described its anti-pathological effects or mechanism  in RA. The present study investigated the mechanism of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. in  an experimental collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The effects of four different Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. extracts on the  proliferation of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) were  screened in an MTT assay, and apoptotic effects were detected by flow cytometry.  Among the extracts, the 70\% ethanol extract (EU70) presented the best inhibition  and was further investigated for its curative effect in CIA rats. Foot swelling  was detected, and the arthritis index (AI) was scored. Pathological improvement  was assessed by haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining of joint tissues. The  mechanistic effects of EU70 were investigated as follows: anti-inflammatory  effects in Th17-positive cells by flow cytometry; serum levels of inflammatory  cytokines by ELISA; TNF{$\alpha$} and IL-1{$\beta$} expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC); and  anti-osteoclastogenesis by QPCR detection of RANKL and OPG mRNA. RESULTS:  Compared with vehicle treatment in CIA model rats, EU70 significantly ameliorated  foot swelling, decreased AI in vivo and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration  and synoviocyte proliferation. EU70 decreased the number of Th17-positive cells  in the spleen and the serum levels of cytokines, including IL-17, IL-1{$\beta$} and TNF{$\alpha$},  and upregulated the serum levels of IL-10; these results indicated the  anti-inflammatory effect of EU70. Moreover, EU70 effectively suppressed TNF{$\alpha$} and  IL-1{$\beta$} expression in the joint tissues and resulted in the downregulation of RANKL  mRNA and the upregulation of OPG mRNA. These results revealed the possible  preventive role of EU70 against bone destruction. CONCLUSION: For the first time,  these mechanisms and pathological improvements support the clinical use of  Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. in treating RA. The findings indicated that the 70\%  ethanol extract of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. could relieve RA symptoms by (1)  suppressing the proliferation of synoviocytes, (2) reducing the number of  Th17-positive cells and downregulating serum IL-17 expression, (3) increasing the  anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10, (4) inhibiting the serum and tissue levels of  key pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF{$\alpha$} and IL-1{$\beta$}, and (5) reducing the degradation  of cartilage and bone.},

HepG2 cells cultured in a  high-glucose medium were classified into different groups. The results displayed  EBEG-treated cells showed better glucose utilization than the negative controls;  thus, the hypoglycemic effect of EBEG was much greater than that of granules  prepared using either component alone, thereby indicating that this effect was  due to a synergistic action of the components. Further, glucose consumption  levels in the cells treated with EBEG (156.35\% at 200\,{$\mu$}g/mL) and the positive  controls (metformin, 162.29\%; insulin, 161.52\%) were similar. Thus, EBEG  exhibited good potential for use as a natural antidiabetic agent. The  hypoglycemic effect of EBEG could be due to the synergistic action of  polysaccharides from the moso bamboo leaves and chlorogenic acids from E.  ulmoides Oliv. leaves via the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase and  glucose-6-phosphate displacement enzyme.},

Our results showed that aucubin and GPA in R. glutinosa  leaves were much lower than catalpol and showed the increasing trend with the  leaf development, which was different from catalpol. This work provided the  important information for future exploitation of R. glutinosa leaves as a  potential supplement for its roots in extraction of some important bioactive  compounds and studying the relationship of aucubin and catalpol metabolism.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: An efficacious antidepressant without unwanted side effects is need urgently at present. This study aimed to investigate whether  treatment with four Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs), namely Radix Astragali,  Saposhnikovia divaricate (SD), Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. bark (EU), and Corydalis  yanhusuo W. T. Wang (C. yanhusuo), could reverse the effects of chronic mild  stress (CMS) in a depression-like mouse model and the potential mechanism(s) of  their action. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro study, the proliferation of NSCs  was assessed using the MTS assay. In vivo study, chronic mild stress (CMS) was  used in mice for 14 days to establish a depression-like mouse model. Plasma  corticosterone levels were assessed by UPLC coupled to a triple-quadrupole mass  spectrometer. The forced swim test (FST) was used to assess the effects of the  four CHMs on depression. BrdU incorporation and TUNEL staining were used to assay  hippocampal precursor cell proliferation rate and apoptosis. RESULTS: The CHMs  included Radix Astragali, EU, C. yanhusuo, and SD were shown to promote  neuroproliferation in vitro. In vivo study, oral administration of these four  CHMs for 14 days reversed the elevated plasma corticosterone levels, body weight  loss, decrease in proliferation of hippocampal precursor cells; they also  inhibited hippocampal cell apoptosis, and exhibited an antidepressant-like effect  in a depression-like mouse model induced by CMS. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates  that each of these CHMs has the potential to ameliorate depression. The possible  mechanisms of action include modulation of the HPA axis, reduction in stress  hormone levels, inhibition of apoptosis, and promotion of hippocampal neuronal  plasticity and neurogenesis.},

METHODS: Fifty male  mice were randomly divided into 5 groups, normal control group, lead group,  positive control group, the total flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides groups( 200, 50  mg / kg). The lead poisoning model was established by peritoneally injecting mice  with 70 mg / kg lead acetate every day for 8 days. After the total flavonoids of  Eucommia ulmoides was gavaged for 14 days, mice were sacrificed and immediately  subjected to necropsy. The concentration of lead in blood, spleen and thymus were  determined. The spleen and thymus index and the content of T-SOD、GSH-Px、T-AOC and  MDA of spleen and thymus in mice were assayed. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal injection  of 70 mg / kg lead acetate for 8 consecutive days could cause an immunity decline  in lead poisoning mice, the total flavonoids of Eucommiaulmoides could  significantly improve the immunity of lead poisoning mice. After the total  flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides was gavaged for 14 days, the viscera index in  mice induced by lead acetate was significantly improve( P {$<$} 0. 01). Compared with  lead group, the total flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides( 200 mg / kg) could  significantly reduce the lead contents in blood, spleen and thymus and improve  the activities of T-SOD、GSH-Px、TAOC and reduce the content of MDA of mouse spleen  and thymus( P {$<$} 0. 01), while there were no significant changes in concentrations  of the lead contents in blood, spleen and thymus in the total flavonoids of  Eucommia ulmoides( 50 mg / kg) treatment group. But the total flavonoids of  Eucommia ulmoides( 50 mg / kg) could increase the activities of  T-SOD、GSH-Px、T-AOC and reduce the content of MDA of mouse spleen and thymus in  different degree. CONCLUSION: The total flavonoids of Eucommia ulmoides can  effectively improve the antioxidant ability of immune organs in mice induced by  lead acetate.},

The present study aimed to investigate the  anti-aging effect and mechanisms of QEF on D-galactose-induced aging mice. A  mouse subacute aging model was established by subcutaneous injection of  D-galactose at the neck consecutively for 8 weeks. Motor activity and memory  impairment of the mice were evaluated by the rotarod test and passive avoidance  test, respectively. Serum and liver parameters were analyzed with biochemical  kits. Hippocampal mRNA and protein expression levels were examined by reverse  transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting,  respectively. QEF administration significantly ameliorated the impaired motor and  memory of aging mice. In the serum, QEF reduced blood urea nitrogen, creatinine,  nitric oxide (NO) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and inhibited alanine  aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities. In the liver, QEF  increased the glutathione level, enhanced total antioxidant capacity and catalase  activity, deceased NO and MDA production, and reduced NO synthase activity. In  the hippocampus, QEF elevated gene expression levels of Klotho, sirtuin 1  (SIRT1), forkhead box transcription factor O3, peroxisome proliferator-activated  receptor {$\gamma$} coactivator 1{$\alpha$} (PGC-1{$\alpha$}), insulin-like growth factor-1 and  peroxiredoxin-3. QEF increased protein expression levels of Klotho and SIRT1, and  decreased that of PGC-1{$\alpha$} in the hippocampus. In conclusion, QEF attenuated the  aging process in D-galactose-treated mice, which may be mediated through  enhancing the antioxidants in the body, protecting renal and hepatic health, and  balancing hippocampal expression levels of the longevity-related genes.},

The natural resources of E. ulmoides have rapidly  declined in recent years because of the over-collection of its cortex. To design  a suitable protection strategy, it is necessary to develop a set of molecular  markers to investigate genetic diversity and population structure of E. ulmoides.  Pyrosequencing of an enriched microsatellite library by Roche 454 FLX+ platform  was used to isolate simple sequence repeats (SSRs) for E. ulmoides. A total of  1568 SSRs that contained enough flanking sequences for primer pair design were  identified from 45,236 raw sequence reads. One hundred SSRs were randomly  selected to design primer pairs and polymerase chain reaction was performed.  Among these 100 tested primer pairs, 16 were polymorphic across 18 individuals  from three E. ulmoides populations. The number of alleles ranged from 3 to 8,  with an average of 5.1. The expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.110 to 0.830,  with an average of 0.648, and the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.111 to  0.833, with an average of 0.524. The inbreeding coefficient ranged from -0.349 to  0.547. This set of microsatellite markers could be valuable for landscape genetic  structure assessment and molecular marker-assisted breeding in E. ulmoides.},

In this study, we measured the inhibitory effects of  several Eucommia ulmoides extracts on the formation of AGEs,  N({$\epsilon$})-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and N({$\omega$})-(carboxymethyl)arginine (CMA). Although  a crude extract obtained from E. ulmoides bark is widely used as herbal medicine,  E. ulmoides leaf extract (ELE) inhibited CML and CMA formation more effectively  during the incubation of gelatin with ribose. Therefore, the inhibitory effects  of compounds present in ELE on CML and CMA formation were studied. As a result,  isoquercetin showed the strongest inhibitory effect of all the tested ELE  components. These results indicate that the oral intake of ELE may inhibit the  formation of AGEs, thereby ameliorating age-related diseases.},

Glycolysis provides both cellular energy and the intermediates  for other biosynthetic processes. However, nothing was known about the molecular  basis of the glycolytic pathway in E. ulmoides kernels. The purposes of this  study were to identify novel genes of E. ulmoides related to glycolytic  metabolism and to analyze the expression patterns of selected genes in the  kernels. Transcriptome sequencing based on the Illumina platform generated 96,469  unigenes in four cDNA libraries constructed using RNAs from 70 and 160 days after  flowering kernels of both low- and high-ALA varieties. We identified and  characterized the digital expression of 120 unigenes coding for 24 protein  families involved in kernel glycolytic pathway. The expression levels of  glycolytic genes were generally higher in younger kernels than in more mature  kernels. Importantly, several unigenes from kernels of the high-ALA variety were  expressed more than those from the low-ALA variety. The expression of 10 unigenes  encoding key enzymes in the glycolytic pathway was validated by qPCR using RNAs  from six kernel stages of each variety. The qPCR data were well consistent with  their digital expression in transcriptomic analyses. This study identified a  comprehensive set of genes for glycolytic metabolism and suggests that several  glycolytic genes may play key roles in ALA accumulation in the kernels of E.  ulmoides.},

(EUE) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated  microglial BV-2 cells and found that EUE inhibited LPS-mediated up-regulation of  pro-inflammatory response factors. In addition, EUE inhibited the elevated  production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mediators, and reactive oxygen species  (ROS) in LPS-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells. Subsequent mechanistic studies  revealed that EUE suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated  protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, glycogen synthase  kinase-3{$\beta$} (GSK-3{$\beta$}), and their downstream transcription factor, nuclear  factor-kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B). EUE also blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-{$\kappa$}B and  inhibited its binding to DNA. We next demonstrated that EUE induced the nuclear  translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and  upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression. We determined that the  significant up-regulation of HO-1 expression by EUE was a consequence of Nrf2  nuclear translocation; furthermore, EUE increased the DNA binding of Nrf2. In  contrast, zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP), a specific HO-1 inhibitor, blocked the  ability of EUE to inhibit NO and PGE{$_2$} production, indicating the vital role of  HO-1. Overall, our results indicate that EUE inhibits pro-inflammatory responses  by modulating MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and GSK-3{$\beta$}, consequently suppressing NF-{$\kappa$}B  activation and inducing Nrf2-dependent HO-1 activation.},

Pretreatment with both low-dose and high-dose aucubin significantly reduced the  number of death neurons ([Formula: see text]) and increased the number of  surviving neurons ([Formula: see text]) in DG, Hilus, CA1 and CA3 hippocampal  regions post SE. Meanwhile, it significantly inhibited necroptosis proteins (MLKL  and RIP-1) ([Formula: see text] or [Formula: see text]) and enhanced autophagy  protein (Beclin-1 and LC3BII/LC3BI) prevalence in the hippocampus ([Formula: see  text] or [Formula: see text]). In conclusion, aucubin appeared to ameliorate  damages in lithium-pilocarpine induced SE in hippocampus, reduce the number of  apoptotic neurons, and increased the number of survival neurons by inducing  autophagy and inhibiting necroptosis. These original findings might provide an  important basis for the further investigation of the therapeutic role of aucubin  in treatment or prevention of epilepsy-related neuronal damages.},

Aucubin is an active component extracted from  Eucommia ulmoides, which has liver-protection effects. However the mechanisms are  still unclear. To investigate the inhibitory effects and the underlying  mechanisms of aucubin on TGF-{$\beta$}1-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells and  ECM deposition, Human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2 cells) were incubated with  TGF-{$\beta$}1 to evaluate the anti-fibrotic effect of aucubin. Western blot was used to  investigate the expression of {$\alpha$}-SMA, Col I, Col III, MMP-2 and TIMP-1. ROS  production was monitored using DCFH-DA probe, and NOX4 expression was detected by  Real-time PCR. Results indicated that TGF-{$\beta$}1 stimulated the activation and ECM  deposition of LX-2 cells. Compared with the control group, aucubin and  aucubigenin both reduced the protein expression of {$\alpha$}-SMA, Col I, Col III and  MMP-2 in LX-2 cells. Aucubin and aucubigenin also suppressed the generation of  ROS and down-regulated the NOX4 mRNA expression. Taken together, aucubin and  aucubigenin both inhibit the activation and ECM deposition of LX-2 cells  activated by TGF-{$\beta$}1. Aucubin and aucubigenin are potential therapeutic candidate  drugs for liver fibrosis.},

METHODS: Dietary treatments  were as follows: i) diet C (control diet); ii) diet F (diet C+10\% flaxseeds);  iii) diet P, (diet C+10\% perilla seeds); iv) diet E (diet C+10\% E. ulmoides  seeds); v) diet A (diet C+1.5\% microalage); vi) diet AF (diet C+10\%  flaxseeds+1.5\% microalage); vii) diet AP (diet C+10\% perilla seeds+1.5\%  microalgae); viii) diet AE (diet C+10\% E. ulmoides seeds+ 1.5\% microalage).  RESULTS: Egg weight, yolk weight and production ratio were not significantly  affected by either algae or in combination with seeds (p{$>$}0.05). No significant  difference was observed in ALA and DHA concentration in eggs between flaxseed,  perila, and E. ulmodies seeds supplementation alone (p{$>$}0.05). N-3 PUFA in eggs  was slightly improved by microalgae supplementation. The best supplementation, a  combination of microalgae and perilla seeds, elevated (p{$<$}0.05) ALA from 19.7 to  202.5 mg/egg and EPA+DHA from 27.5 to 159.7 mg/egg. Highest n-3 PUFA enrichment  (379.6 mg/yolk) was observed with supplementation of a combination of perilla  seed and microalgae (362.2 mg/yolk), followed by a combination of flaxseed and  microalgae (348.4 mg/yolk). The ALA, EPA, and DHA content obtained with a  combination of microalgae and seeds surpassed the total sum of that obtained with  microalgae or ALA-seeds alone. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to enrich eggs with n-3  PUFAs by perilla or E. ulmodies seeds instead of flaxseeds. Simultaneous  supplementation of microalgae and seeds helped improve the transfer from EPA and  docosapentaenoic acid into DHA.},

To explore the effects of chronic administration of ELE on body weight,  blood pressure and aortic media thickness, 7-week-old male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY)  rats were orally administered a normal diet, a 30\% HFD, or a 5\% ELE plus HFD ad  libitum for 10 weeks. The HFD treatment caused mild obesity and hypertension in  the normotensive rats, while rats receiving both ELE and the HFD had  significantly lower body weights, less visceral and perirenal fat, lower blood  pressure and thinner aortic media than the control rats receiving the HFD only.  The plasma adiponectin/leptin ratio also improved in ELE-treated rats. Although  plasma leptin levels were elevated in all HFD rats, adiponectin levels increased  only in the ELE-treated rats. Anti-hypertensive and anti-obesity effects may be  caused by the geniposidic acid (GEA) and/or asperuloside present in ELE. These  findings suggest that chronic ELE administration prevents aortic media  hypertrophy in early-stage obesity with hypertension. Long-term administration of  ELE might inhibit the development of arteriosclerosis.},

To understand the  mechanism of TPI biosynthesis at the transcriptional level, comprehensive gene  expression data from various organs were generated and TPI biosynthesis related  genes were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA). The metabolic pathway  was assessed by comparing the coexpression network of TPI genes with the  isoprenoid gene coexpression network of model plants. By PCA, we dissected 27  genes assumed to be involved in polyisoprene biosynthesis, including TIDS genes,  genes encoding enzymes of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the  2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway, and genes related to rubber  synthesis. The coexpression network revealed that 22 of the 27 TPI biosynthesis  genes are coordinately expressed. The network was clustered into two modules, and  this was also observed in model plants. The first module was mainly comprised of  MEP pathway genes and TIDS1 gene, and the second module, of MVA pathway genes and  TIDS5 gene. These results indicate that TPI is likely biosynthesized by both the  MEP and MVA pathways and that TIDS gene expression is differentially controlled  by these pathways.},

Treatments of osteoporosis consist of pharmacotherapy and  non-pharmacological interventions, such as mineral supplementation, lifestyle  changes, and exercise programs. Due to the minimum side effects and favorable  cost-effective therapeutic effects, herbal medicine has been widely applied in  clinical practices for more than 2,000 years in China. Of the many traditional  formulas reported for treating bone diseases, 4 single herbs namely (1) Herba  Epimedii, (2) Rhizoma Drynariae, (3) Fructus Psoraleae, and (4) Cortex Eucommiae,  are considered as the featured "Kidney-Yang" tonics, and frequently and  effectively applied for preventing and treating osteoporosis. With the accruing  development of modern chemistry, hundreds of active compounds have been  identified and isolated for their anti-osteoporotic effects. This review would  first sketch the phytochemistry of these featured "Kidney- Yang" tonics and  present the pharmacological characteristics of the most abundant and bioactive  compounds derived from the herb Herba Epimedii and Rhizoma Drynariae, including  icariin and naringin. Then, the cellular and molecular underpinnings under  anti-osteoporotic effects of icariin and naringin are discussed. The concerned  structure-function relationships of the featured active herbal compounds would  also be reviewed so as to pave the way for future drug design in treating  osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {Backgroud: Pinoresinol (Pin) and pinoresinol monoglucoside (PMG) are plant-derived lignan molecules with multiple functions. We showed previously that  an endophytic fungus from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., Phomopsis sp. XP-8 is able to  produce Pin and PMG. OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to test the anti-tumor  capability of the culture of XP-8 and identify the major effective compounds.  METHOD: The fungal culture was added in the culture of HepG2 and K562 cells, and  the viabilities of these cells were detected and the possible mechanism was  analyzed. RESULT: The fungal culture showed significant capaiblity in decreasing  the viability of tumor cells and induce apoptosis via up-regulation of the  expression of apoptosis-related genes. It also significantly inhibited the  adhesion and migration of HepG2 cells by blocking MMP-9 expression. Pin and PMG  were isolated from the growth culture and shown to be the major effective  components for inhibition. CONCLUSION: The study indicated the potential  application of XP-8 in the production of anti-tumour products by the  bioconversion of glucose.},

Without the true identity of these molecules it is impossible to draw conclusions about the biological mechanisms, pathway relationships and provenance of compounds. The only way at present to address this discrepancy is to use in silico fragmentation software to identify unknown compounds by comparing and ranking theoretical MS/MS fragmentations from target structures to experimental tandem mass spectra (MS/MS). We compared the performance of four publicly available in silico fragmentation algorithms (MetFragCL, CFM-ID, MAGMa+ and MS-FINDER) that participated in the 2016 CASMI challenge. We found that optimizing the use of metadata, weighting factors and the manner of combining different tools eventually defined the ultimate outcomes of each method. We comprehensively analysed how outcomes of different tools could be combined and reached a final success rate of 93\% for the training data, and 87\% for the challenge data, using a combination of MAGMa+, CFM-ID and compound importance information along with MS/MS matching. Matching MS/MS spectra against the MS/MS libraries without using any in silico tool yielded 60\% correct hits, showing that the use of in silico methods is still important.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fourth round of the Critical Assessment of Small Molecule Identification (CASMI) Contest ( www.casmi-contest.org ) was held in 2016, with two new categories for automated methods. This article covers the 208 challenges in Categories 2 and 3, without and with metadata, from organization, participation, results and post-contest evaluation of CASMI 2016 through to perspectives for future contests and small molecule annotation/identification. RESULTS: The Input Output Kernel Regression (CSI:IOKR) machine learning approach performed best in "Category 2: Best Automatic Structural Identification-In Silico Fragmentation Only", won by Team Brouard with 41\% challenge wins. The winner of "Category 3: Best Automatic Structural Identification-Full Information" was Team Kind (MS-FINDER), with 76\% challenge wins. The best methods were able to achieve over 30\% Top~1 ranks in Category~2, with all methods ranking the correct candidate in the Top~10 in around 50\% of challenges. This success rate rose to 70\% Top~1 ranks in Category~3, with candidates in the Top~10 in over 80\% of the challenges. The machine learning and chemistry-based approaches are shown to perform in complementary ways. CONCLUSIONS: The improvement in (semi-)automated fragmentation methods for small molecule identification has been substantial. The achieved high rates of correct candidates in the Top~1 and Top~10, despite large candidate numbers, open up great possibilities for high-throughput annotation of untargeted analysis for "known unknowns". As more high quality training data becomes available, the improvements in machine learning methods will likely continue, but the alternative approaches still provide valuable complementary information. Improved integration of experimental context will also improve identification success further for "real life" annotations. The true "unknown unknowns" remain to be evaluated in future CASMI contests.

The liver has a central role during sepsis, and is essential to the regulation of immune defence during systemic infections by mechanisms such as bacterial clearance, acute-phase protein or cytokine production and metabolic adaptation to inflammation. However, the liver is also a target for sepsis-related injury, including hypoxic hepatitis due to ischaemia and shock, cholestasis due to altered bile metabolism, hepatocellular injury due to drug toxicity or overwhelming inflammation, as well as distinct pathologies such as secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients. Hence, hepatic dysfunction substantially impairs the prognosis of sepsis and serves as a powerful independent predictor of mortality in the intensive care unit. Sepsis is particularly problematic in patients with liver cirrhosis (who experience increased bacterial translocation from the gut and impaired microbial defence) as it can trigger acute-on-chronic liver failure - a syndrome with high short-term mortality. Here, we review the importance of the liver as a guardian, modifier and target of sepsis, the factors that contribute to sepsis in patients with liver cirrhosis and new therapeutic strategies.},

Nevertheless, the genetic mechanisms of sexual  dimorphism and sex determination in E. ulmoides remain poorly understood. In this  study de novo transcriptome sequencing on Illumina platform generated {$>$}45 billion  high-quality bases from fresh leaves of six male and female individuals of E.  ulmoides. A total of 148,595 unigenes with an average length of 801 base-pairs  (bp) were assembled. Through comparative transcriptome analyses, 116  differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the males and the females were  detected, including 73 male-biased genes and 43 female-biased genes. Of these  DEGs, three female-biased genes were annotated to be related with the sexually  dimorphic gutta content in E. ulmoides. One male-biased DEG was identified as  putative MADS box gene APETALA3, a B class floral organ identity gene in the  flowering plants. SNPs calling analyses further confirmed that the APETALA3-like  gene was probably involved in the sex determination in E. ulmoides. Four other  male-biased DEGs were potential sex-associated genes as well with segregated SNPs  in accord with sex type. In addition, the SNPs density was 1.02 per kilobase (kb)  in the expressed genes of E. ulmoides, implying a relatively high genetic  diversity.},

This is the first  report on the identification and analysis of MAPK cascades in Eucommia ulmoides.  We conducted a genome-wide screening and identified 13 EuMAPKs, five EuMAPKKs,  and 57 EuMAPKKKs. The construction of phylogenetic trees revealed that EuMAPKs  and EuMAPKKs were divided into four groups (A, B, C, and D), and EuMAPKKKs were  divided into three subfamilies (MEKK, RAF, and ZIK). These subfamilies were  further confirmed by conserved domain/motif analysis and gene structure analysis.  Based on the expression profiles of all identified EuMAPK cascades in various  organs at different developmental stages, three genes (EuRAF22-2, EuRAF34-1, and  EuRAF33-2) with stable expression patterns at all stages of fruit or leaf  development, three genes (EuRAF2-3, EuMPK11, and EuMEKK21) with differential  expression patterns, and two highly expressed genes (EuZIK1 and EuMKK2) were  screened and validated by qRT-PCR. Overall, our results could be used for further  research on the precise role of MAPK cascades during organ development in E.  ulmoides.},

Resistance to Erysiphe cichoracearum de  Candolle (E.cichoracearum DC) and molecular mechanisms in the transgenic tobacco  were determined by drop inoculation, spore counting, determination of  physicochemical indicators, and analysis of gene expression. The chitinase  activity and resistance to E. cichoracearum DC were significantly higher in the  transgenic tobacco than in wild-type tobacco (p {$<$} 0.05). The activities of  peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT), after inoculation with E. cichoracearum DC,  were higher in the transgenic tobacco than in the wild-type. Conversely, the  malondialdehyde (MDA) content was significantly lower in the transgenic tobacco  than the wild-type before and after inoculation. In addition, our study also  indicated that the resistance to E. cichoracearum DC might involve the salicylic  acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways, because the expression levels of  pathogenesis-related gene 1 (PR-1a) and coronatine-insensitive 1 (COI1) were  significantly increased and decreased, respectively, after inoculation with E.  cichoracearum DC. The present study supports the notion that PR-1a and POD  participate in resistance to E. cichoracearum DC in the transgenic tobacco  plants.},

  abstract = {AIMS: Aucubin, an iridoid glycoside, was isolated from seeds of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver. This study was aimed to evaluate the protective effect of aucubin against  ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were  orally administrated with aucubin (20, 40 and 80mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days. On  the 3rd day, the mice of gastric mucosal injury were induced with 70\% ethanol  after the last administration of aucubin. Gastric tissue of mice were submitted  for evaluating the severity of gastric mucosal injury. The protective effect of  aucubin was evaluated by the gastric ulcer index and histological examinations  and determining the levels of inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and some  gastric mucosal protection factors. KEY FINDINGS: Prophylactic oral  administration of aucubin decreased gastric ulcer indexes and histological  scores. A significant decrease of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and the levels  of malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}) and interleukin-6  (IL-6) were observed in aucubin administrated groups. In addition, mice  administrated with aucubin increased glutathione (GSH) and heat shock protein-70  (HSP-70) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, as well as normalized  the levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor  (VEGF) and cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in gastric tissue of mice. SIGNIFICANCE: The  findings of this study demonstrated that aucubin shows protective effect against  ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal injury through its anti-inflammatory and  anti-oxidant effects. Furthermore, aucubin enhanced gastric mucosal protection by  up-regulation of HSP-70 level and normalization of EGF, VEGF and COX-1 levels.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nano bamboo charcoal is being widely used as sustained release carrier for chemicals for its high specific surface area, sound biocompatibility,  and nontoxicity; however, there have been no reports on nano bamboo charcoal as  sustained release carrier for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). OBJECTIVE: To  study the effect of nano bamboo charcoal in absorbing and sustained releasing  Eucommia ulmoides extract (EUE) and to verify the in vitro anticancer effect of  the sustained release liquid, so as to provide a theoretical basis for the  development and utilization of nano bamboo charcoal as TCM sustained-release  preparation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The adsorption capacity for the nano bamboo  charcoal on EUE was measured by Langmuir model, and the release experiment was  carried out under intestinal fluid condition. Characteristic changes for the nano  bamboo charcoal nano-drug delivery system with and without adsorption of E.  ulmoides were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform  infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and specific surface area. In  addition, the anticancer effect from this novel bamboo charcoal E. ulmoides  delivery system was evaluated against a human colon cancer cell line (HCT116).  RESULTS: It was found that nano bamboo charcoal exhibits good adsorption capacity  (up to 462.96 mg/g at 37\textdegree C). The cumulative release rate for EUE from this nano  bamboo charcoal delivery system was 70.67\%, and specific surface area for the  nano bamboo charcoal decreased from 820.32 m(2)/g to 443.80 m(2)/g after EUE was  loaded. An in vitro anticancer study showed that the inhibition rate for E.  ulmoides against HCT116 cancer cells was 23.07\%, for this novel bamboo charcoal  nano-drug delivery system. CONCLUSION: This study provides a novel strategy for  the delivery of traditional Chinese medicine using bamboo charcoal nano-drug  delivery system. SUMMARY: The adsorption equilibrium was reached after 30 min of  ultrasonic treatmentThe saturated adsorption capacity of Eucommia ulmoides  extract by nano bamboo charcoal under ultrosonic condition was 462. 96 mg/gThe  cumulative release rate of E. ulmoides extract from the nano bamboo charcoal  delivery system in artificial intestinal juice was 70.67\%The inhibition ratio of  HCT116 cancer cells by sustained release liquid was 23.07\%.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: GCSB-5, an herbal drug composition with an anti-inflammatory effect, is prepared by boiling, which is the most common herbal extraction method in  traditional Korean medicine. Several parameters are involved in the process,  i.e., extractant type, herb-to-extractant ratio, extraction temperature and  pressure, and total boiling time. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to  examine the influence of boiling time on index compound amount and the  antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities of GCSB-5. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  Different samples of GCSB-5 were obtained by decocting for 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,  and 240 min. Each sample was tested for hydrogen ion concentration (pH), total  soluble solid content (TSSC), marker compound profiles, and antioxidative and  anti-inflammatory activity. RESULTS: pH was found to decrease while TSSC  increased with extended decoction. Marker compound contents for GCSB-5  (acanthoside D for Acanthopanax sessiliflorus Seem, 20-hydroxyecdysone for  Achyranthes japonica Nakai, and pinoresinol diglucoside for Eucommia ulmoides  Oliver) remained relatively constant regardless of the length of boiling. Total  D-glucose amount increased with longer boiling. The antioxidative and  anti-inflammatory potentials of GCSB-5 were not substantially affected by  decoction duration. CONCLUSION: Biological characteristics and marker compound  content of GCSB-5 were not altered significantly in prolonged boiling. SUMMARY:  Longer boiling duration of GCSB-5 did not increase yield in a time-dependent  manner, but yields of 210 and 240 min samples were significantly higherHydrogen  ion concentration of GCSB-5 samples decreased while total soluble solid content  and D-glucose concentration levels increased with boiling durationAlthough  concentrations of some index compounds increased with extended boiling duration  of GCSB-5, increase was small and not in a direct proportional  relationshipAntioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties of GCSB-5 were not  substantially affected by decoction duration.

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMOCOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cortex Eucommiae (CE), the bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., has been traditionally used for its kidney-tonifying and bone-  and tendon-enhancing properties in Korea, China, and Japan. CE has been  historically prescribed for inflammatory conditions such as arthritis of the knee  and ankle. AIM OF THE STUDY: Although CE has recently been shown to suppress  inflammation in scientific studies, whether this effect involves modulation of  the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) pathway is currently unknown. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: The modulatory effect of CE on the TLR-4 pathway, both myeloid  differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88)-dependent and independent, was  investigated through real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR), western blotting, and a reporter gene assay in lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. RESULTS: CE dose-dependently  inhibited nitric oxide production without significant cytotoxicity with an IC(50)  of 356.23{$\mu$}g/mL. In addition, CE down-regulated both LPS-induced mRNA and protein  expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),  tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}), and interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}) in a dose-dependent  manner. CE suppressed LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) and the  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which together comprise the  Myd88-dependent TLR-4 pathway. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian  target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was also down-regulated by CE in a  dose-dependent manner. CE additionally suppressed LPS-induced activation of  interferon-{$\beta$} (IFN-{$\beta$}) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)  pathway, which is associated with the Myd88-independent TLR-4 pathway.  CONCLUSIONS: CE down-regulated both Myd88-dependent and independent TLR-4  pathways, thus exerting anti-inflammatory effects. These results suggest that CE  may be used as a potential therapeutic agent against chronic inflammatory  diseases.},

Economically motivated adulterants have been  documented, leading to market instability and a decline in consumer confidence.  ITS2 has been used to identify raw medicinal materials, but it's not suitable for  the identification of botanical extracts and complex CPMs. Therefore, a short  barcode for the identification of processed CPMs would be profitable. A 34\,bp  nucleotide signature (5' CTAGCGGTGGTCGTACGATAGCCAATGCATGAGT 3') was developed  derived from ITS2 region of Eucommiae Folium based on unique motifs. Mixtures of  powdered Lonicerae japonicae Flos and Lonicerae Flos resulted in double peaks at  the expected SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) positions, of which the height  of the peaks were roughly indicative of the species' ratio in the mixed powder.  Subsequently we tested 20 extracts and 47 CPMs labelled as containing some  species of Lonicera. The results revealed only 17\% of the extracts and 22\% of the  CPMs were authentic, others exist substitution or adulterant; 7\% were shown to  contain both of two adulterants Eucommiae Folium and Lonicerae Flos.

XP-8 (an endophytic fungus) was previously found to produce pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG), a major antihypertensive compound of Tu-Chung (the  bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.), which is widely used in Chinese traditional  medicines. In the present study, two bioconversion systems were developed for the  production of PDG in Tris-HCl buffer containing glucose and Phomopsis sp. XP-8  cells (both resting and freeze-dried). When other factors remained unchanged, the  bioconversion time, glucose concentration, cell ages, cell dosage, pH,  temperature, and stirring speed influenced PDG production in a similar and  decreasing manner after an initial increase with increasing levels for each  factor. Considering the simultaneous change of various factors, the optimal  conditions for PDG production were established as 70 g/l cells (8-day-old), 14  g/l glucose, 28\textdegree C, pH 7.5, and 180 rpm for systems employing resting cells, and  3.87 g/l cells, 14.67 g/l glucose, 28\textdegree C, pH 7.5, and 180 rpm for systems  employing freeze-dried cells. The systems employing freeze-dried cells showed  lower peak PDG production (110.28 {$\mu$}g/l), but at a much shorter time (12.65 h)  compared with resting cells (23.62 mg/l, 91.5 h). The specific PDG production  levels were 1.92 and 24 {$\mu$}g per gram cells per gram glucose for freeze-dried cells  and resting cells, respectively.

Signaling pathways  mediated by DZSY21 were analyzed by testing the expression of key plant genes  involved in regulation of salicylic acid (SA) or JA/ET pathways, the  defense-related genes PR1 and LOX were concurrently expressed in the leaves of  DZSY21-treated plants; this corresponded to slight increase in the expression  level of PDF1.2 and decreases in ERF gene transcription levels. The results  indicated an induced systemic response that is dependent on the SA and jasmonic  acid (JA) pathways. Thus, we hypothesized that the strain DZSY21 inhibits B.  maydis by producing antifungal lipopeptides and activating an induced systemic  response through SA- and JA-dependent signaling pathways. This work describes a  mechanism behind reduced disease severity in plants inoculated with the  endophytic bacteria DZSY21.},

We separated  three polysaccharide fractions from this herb based on acidity and screened them  for their activity in modulating the phenotype of murine macrophages. Among them,  EUP1 was the only fraction to exert such a function - it stimulated Raw 264.7  cells to express CD206 and a key anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10.  Having fully characterised EUP1 with a series of chromatographic and  spectroscopic analyses, we evaluated its anti-inflammatory effects in both in  vitro and in vivo inflammatory models. In the murine model of sepsis induced by  lipopolysaccharide, administration of EUP1 effectively suppressed the expression  of major inflammatory cytokines, alleviated lung injury and increased animal  survival rate. In summary, EUP1, with a clearly elucidated chemical structure and  solid anti-inflammatory activity, may become a valuable candidate for further  development into an anti-septic therapeutic agent.},

After oral administration of 3\,mL/kg E. ulmoides extract in rats, the  maximum plasma concentrations of pinoresinol glucoside and chlorogenic acid were  57.44 and 61.04\,ng/mL, respectively. The times to reach the maximum plasma  concentration were 40.00 and 23.33\,min for pinoresinol glucoside and chlorogenic  acid, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precision (RSD) values for the two  analytes were {$<$}2.46 and 5.15\%, respectively, and the accuracy (RE) values ranged  from -12.76 to 0.00.

  abstract = {Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) is an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of prenyl precursors for the production of primary and secondary metabolites,  including sterols, dolichols, carotenoids and ubiquinones, and for the  modification of proteins. Here we identified and characterized two FPSs (EuFPS1  and EuFPS2) from the plant Eucommia ulmoides. The EuFPSs had seven highly  conserved prenyltransferase-specific domains that are critical for activity.  Complementation and biochemical analyses using bacterially produced recombinant  EuFPS isoforms showed that the EuFPSs had FPP synthesis activities both in~vivo  and in~vitro. In addition to the typical reaction mechanisms of FPS, EuFPSs  utilized farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as an allylic substrate and participated in  further elongation of the isoprenyl chain, resulting in the synthesis of  geranylgeranyl diphosphate. However, despite the high amino acid similarities  between the two EuFPS isozymes, their specific activities, substrate preferences,  and final reaction products were different. The use of dimethylallyl diphosphate  (DMAPP) as an allylic substrate highlighted the differences between the two  enzymes: depending on the pH, the metal ion cofactor, and the cofactor  concentration, EuFPS2 accumulated geranyl diphosphate as an intermediate product  at a constant rate, whereas EuFPS1 synthesized little geranyl diphosphate. The  reaction kinetics of the EuFPSs demonstrated that isopentenyl diphosphate and  DMAPP were used both as substrates and as inhibitors of EuFPS activity. Taken  together, the results indicate that the biosynthesis of FPP is highly regulated  by various factors indispensable for EuFPS reactions in plants.},

The  effects of the pore structure of the carbon adsorbents on the adsorption capacity  were studied. Of the four adsorbents investigated, mesoporous carbon (MC3) showed  the highest adsorption capacity (294\,mg/g of carbon) for chlorogenic acid due to  its high mesopore volume. The static adsorption of CGA on carbon can be  accurately described using the Freundlich equation. The kinetics of adsorption  follow a pseudo-second-order process. External mass transfer was the controlling  step of the adsorption process. Dynamic adsorption on MC3 demonstrated that  chlorogenic acid began to break through after 28 bed volumes of extract was  loaded. This mesoporous carbon-treatment procedure is safe, economic and has the  potential to be scaled up for commercial application.},

By using the ion  filtering approach, target constituents of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. were easily  tentatively identified from the enormous LC/MS data set. The strategy consisted  of the following three steps: 1) To establishing a characteristic ion database by  diagnostic product ions or neutral loss fragments; 2) To evaluate the structural  information of the compounds by high-resolution diagnostic characteristic ion  filtering; 3) To confirm the different classes by chemical profiling according to  their MS/MS spectra. In this study, characteristic ions are summarized as five  major groups of compounds in Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. In total, 113 compounds were  tentatively identified, including 23 potentially novel compounds. The results  form a foundation for the quality control and chemical basis of Eucommia ulmoides  Oliv.},

In this study, one complete  chloroplast (cp) genome of E. ulmoides was generated via the genome skimming  approach and compared to another available E. ulmoides cp genome comprehensively  at the genome scale. We found that the structure of the cp genome in E. ulmoides  was highly consistent with genome size variation which might result from DNA  repeat variations in the two E. ulmoides cp genomes. Heterogeneous sequence  divergence patterns were revealed in different regions of the E. ulmoides cp  genomes, with most (59 out of 75) of the detected SNPs (single nucleotide  polymorphisms) located in the gene regions, whereas most (50 out of 80) of the  indels (insertions/deletions) were distributed in the intergenic spacers. In  addition, we also found that all the 40 putative coding-region-located SNPs were  synonymous mutations. A total of 71 polymorphic cpDNA fragments were further  identified, among which 20 loci were selected as potential molecular markers for  subsequent population genetics studies of E. ulmoides. Moreover, eight  polymorphic cpSSR loci were also developed. The sister relationship between E.  ulmoides and Aucuba japonica in Garryales was also confirmed based on the cp  phylogenomic analyses. Overall, this study will shed new light on the  conservation genomics of this endangered plant in the future.},

Previous studies have indicated that YHHJ treatment has a beneficial  effect on ameliorating itching and reducing serum bile acid levels in patients  with intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). However, the molecular  mechanisms of action of YHHJ in ICP have not been fully elucidated. Therefore,  the present study investigated an experimental hepatocellular cholestasis model  to explore the regulatory role of YHHJ on the expression of the bile acid  carriers, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and the bile salt  export pump (BSEP). Initially, 5 mg/kg/day 17-{$\alpha$} ethinylestradiol (EE) was used to  induce cholestasis in rats and primary isolated rat hepatocytes. Subsequently, 9  or 36 g/kg/day YHHJ water extract was administrated. Blood samples were collected  and serum biochemical parameters of total bile acids (TBA), total bilirubin  (TBil), alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were  determined. Rat livers and primary isolated rat hepatocytes were obtained and the  protein and mRNA expression levels of MRP2 and BSEP were analyzed by western blot  analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction,  respectively. Results revealed that EE-induced hepatocellular cholestasis was  associated with a significant increase in serum TBA and TBil levels, whereas,  YHHJ treatment significantly reversed this effect (P{$<$}0.01). Further experiments  on the molecular mechanism revealed that EE significantly decreased the  expression of MRP2 and BSEP compared with the control group, whereas YHHJ  treatment significantly upregulated MRP2 and BSEP expression in vivo and in vitro  compared with no YHHJ treatment (P{$<$}0.01). In addition, to establish whether  upregulation of MRP2 and BSEP protein expression levels resulted from increased  expression of their respective mRNA, the mRNA expression levels were determined.  Results indicated that YHHJ treatment significantly increased MRP2 and BSEP mRNA  expression levels in EE-induced hepatocellular cholestasis compared with no YHHJ  treatment (P{$<$}0.01). In conclusion, the present findings suggest that YHHJ effects  EE-induced cholestasis and this process may be mediated through regulating  hepatobiliary transporters, MRP2 and BSEP.},

This review comprehensively collected and  analyzed the traditional Chinese medicines on the treatment and signaling pathway  regulation of osteoporosis in recent ten years, such as Epimedii Folium,  Drynariae Rhizoma, Cnidii Fructus, Eucommiae Cortex, Psoraleae Fructus and  Dipsaci Radix. Based on the existing findings, the following conclusions were  obtained: \ding{172}kidney-tonifying traditional Chinese medicine treated osteoporosis  mainly through BMP-Smads, Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin, MAPK, PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to  promote osteoblast bone formation and through OPG/RANKL/ RANK, estrogen, CTSK  signaling pathway to inhibit osteoclasts of bone resorption. Epimedii Folium,  Drynariae Rhizoma, Cnidii Fructus and Psoraleae Fructus up-regulated the  expression of key proteins and genes of BMP-Smads and Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling  pathways to promote bone formation. Epimedii Folium, Drynariae Rhizoma, Cnidii  Fructus, Eucommiae Cortex, Psoraleae Fructus and Dipsaci Radix inhibited the bone  resorption by mediating the OPG/RANKL/RANK signaling pathway. \ding{173}Kidney-tonifying  traditional Chinese medicine prevented and treated osteoporosis through a variety  of ways: icariin in Epimedii Folium, naringin in Drynariae Rhizoma, osthole in  Cnidii Fructus and psoralen in Psoraleae Fructus can regulate BMP-Smads,  Wnt/{$\beta$}-catenin signaling pathway to promote bone formation, but also activate  OPG/RANKL/RANK, CTSK and other signaling pathways to inhibit bone resorption.  \ding{174}The crosstalk of the signaling pathways and the animal experiments of the  traditional Chinese medicine on the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis as  well as their multi-target mechanism and comprehensive regulation need further  clarification.},

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides Oilv. (EU), also called Du-zhong, is a classical traditional Chinese medicine. Its bark, leaf, and male flower are all used for medicinal  purposes, called Eucommiae Cortex (EC), Eucommiae Folium (EF), and Eucommiae Flos  Male (EFM). In order to study the difference in synthesis and the accumulation of  metabolites in different parts of EU, a reliable method based on ultra-fast  liquid chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry  (UFLC-QTRAP-MS/MS) was developed for the simultaneous determination of a total of  21 constituents, including two lignans, 6 iridoids, 6 penylpropanoids, 6  flavonoids, and one phenol in the samples (EC, EF, and EFM). Furthermore,  principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to evaluate and classify the  samples according to the contents of these 21 constituents. All of the results  demonstrated that the chemical compositions in EC, EF, and EFM were significantly  different and the differential constituents (i.e., aucubin, geniposidic acid,  chlorogenic acid, pinoresinol-di-O-{$\beta$}-d-glucopyranoside, geniposide,  cryptochlorogenic acid, rutin, and quercetin) were remarkably associated with  sample classifications. The research will provide the basic information for  revealing the laws of metabolite accumulation in EC, EF, and EFM from the same  origin.},

Despite evidence of the  protective effects of EU against diabetes, its precise effects and mechanisms of  action against advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are unclear. In this study,  we evaluated the effects of EU on AGEs-induced renal disease and explored the  possible underlying mechanisms using streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice.  STZ-induced diabetic mice received EU extract (200 mg/kg) orally for 6 weeks. EU  treatment did not change blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in  diabetic mice. However, the EU-treated group showed a significant increase in the  protein expression and activity of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), which detoxifies the AGE  precursor, methylglyoxal (MGO). EU significantly upregulated nuclear factor  erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression but downregulated that of receptor  for AGE (RAGE). Furthermore, histological and immunohistochemical analyses of  kidney tissue showed that EU reduced periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive  staining, AGEs, and MGO accumulation in diabetic mice. Based on these findings,  we concluded that EU ameliorated the renal damage in diabetic mice by inhibiting  AGEs formation and RAGE expression and reducing oxidative stress, through the  Glo1 and Nrf2 pathways.},

Makino, and Curcuma  longa L., have been reported to have various immune-modulatory effects. AIM OF  THE STUDY: To determine the effects of extracts from these three TCM on type 1\,T  help (Th1)- and Th2-cytokine responses and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR  expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from septic  patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PBMCs of  healthy controls and septic patients were cultured for 48 hs with or without  0.05/0.1\,mg/ml of TCM extract. HLA-DR expression in monocytes was detected using  flow cytofluorimetry. The interferon [IFN]-{$\gamma$}, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-{$\alpha$},  interleukin (IL)-\,2, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in supernatants were measured  with a human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Treatment with either  0.05 or 0.1\,mg/ml of C. longa L. extract significantly restored the percentage of  HLA-DR-positive monocytes, which was decreased by LPS in control and patient  groups. Treatment with 0.05 or 0.1\,mg/ml E. ulmoides Oliv. and C.longa L. extract  decreased IL-10 production from LPS-stimulated PBMCs of controls and patients. In  patients with sepsis, C. longa L. extract decreased IL-10 production to a greater  degree than did E. ulmoides Oliv extract. Although IFN-{$\gamma$}, TNF-{$\alpha$}, or IL-13  productions from LPS-stimulated PBMCs were influenced by E. ulmoides Oliv., G.  pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino, or C. longa L. in control or sepsis groups in this  study, only the influence of IL-10 was consistent in both control and sepsis  groups. CONCLUSIONS: By enhancing monocyte HLA-DR expression and decreasing IL-10  production, C. longa L. might help restore inflammatory responses in septic  patients to eradicate pathogens.},

The optimum conditions and significant  parameters in SC-CO(2) were obtained using response surface methodology (RSM).  The qualities of the extracted oil were evaluated by physicochemical properties,  fatty acid composition, vitamin E composition. It was found that the optimum  extraction parameters were at pressure of 37 MPa, temperature of 40\textdegree C, extraction  time of 125 min and CO(2) flow rate of 2.6 SL/min. Pressure, temperature and time  were identified as significant parameter effecting on extraction yield. The  importance of evaluated parameters decreased in the order of pressure {$>$}  extraction time {$>$} temperature {$>$} CO(2) flow rate. GC analysis indicated that E.  ulmoides seed oil contained about 61\% of linolenic acid and its fatty acid  composition was similar with that of flaxseed oil and perilla oil. The content  and composition of vitamin E was determined using HPLC. The E. ulmoides seed oil  was rich in vitamin E (190.72 mg/100 g), the predominant vitamin E isomers were  {$\gamma$}- tocopherol and {$\delta$}- tocopherol, which accounted for 70.87\% and 24.81\% of the  total vitamin E, respectively. The high yield and good physicochemical properties  of extracted oil support the notion that SC-CO(2) technology is an effective  technique for extracting oil from E. ulmoides seed.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Aucubin, the predominant component of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., has been shown to have profound effects on oxidative stress. As oxidative  stress has previously been demonstrated to contribute to acute and chronic  myocardial injury, we tested the effects of aucubin on cardiac remodelling and  heart failure. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Initially, H9c2 cardiomyocytes and neonatal  rat cardiomyocytes pretreated with aucubin (1, 3, 10, 25 and 50~{$\mu$}M) were  challenged with phenylephrine. Secondly, the transverse aorta was constricted in  C57/B6 and neuronal NOS (nNOS)-knockout mice, then aucubin (1 or 5~mg{$\cdot$}kg(-1) body  weight day(-1) ) was injected i.p. for 25~days. Hypertrophy was evaluated by  assessing morphological changes, echocardiographic parameters, histological  analyses and hypertrophic markers. Oxidative stress was evaluated by examining  ROS generation, oxidase activity and NO generation. NOS expression was determined  by Western blotting. KEY RESULTS: Aucubin effectively suppressed cardiac  remodelling; in mice, aucubin substantially inhibited pressure overload-induced  cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and inflammation, whereas knocking out nNOS  abolished these cardioprotective effects of aucubin. Blocking or knocking down  the {$\beta$}(3) -adrenoceptor abolished the protective effects of aucubin in vitro.  Furthermore, aucubin enhanced the protective effects of a {$\beta$}(3) -adrenoceptor  agonist in vitro by increasing cellular cAMP levels, whereas treatment with an  adenylate cyclase (AC) inhibitor abolished the cardioprotective effects of  aucubin. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Aucubin suppresses oxidative stress during  cardiac remodelling by increasing the expression of nNOS in a process that  requires activation of the {$\beta$}(3) -adrenoceptor/AC/cAMP pathway. These findings  suggest that aucubin could have potential as a treatment for cardiac remodelling  and heart failure.},

Moreover, B. velezensis 157 also showed various lignocellulolytic  activities including cellulase, xylanase, {$\alpha$}-amylase, and pectinase, which had the  ability of using the agro-industrial waste (soybean meal, wheat bran, sugarcane  bagasse, wheat straw, rice husk, maize flour and maize straw) under solid-state  fermentation and obtained several industrially valuable enzymes. Soybean meal  appeared to be the most efficient substrate for the single fermentation of B.  velezensis 157. Highest yield of pectinase (19.15~{$\pm~$}2.66~U~g(-1)), cellulase  (46.69~{$\pm~$}1.19~U~g(-1)) and amylase (2097.18~{$\pm~$}15.28~U~g(-1)) was achieved on  untreated soybean meal. Highest yield of xylanase (22.35~{$\pm~$}2.24~U~g(-1)) was  obtained on untreated wheat bran. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of  the B. velezensis 157, composed of a circular 4,013,317~bp chromosome with 3789  coding genes and a G~+~C content of 46.41\%, one circular 8439~bp plasmid and a  G~+~C content of 40.32\%. The genome contained a total of 8 candidate gene  clusters (bacillaene, difficidin, macrolactin, butirosin, bacillibactin,  bacilysin, fengycin and surfactin), and dedicates over 15.8\% of the whole genome  to synthesize secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In addition, the genes encoding  enzymes involved in degradation of cellulose, xylan, lignin, starch, mannan,  galactoside and arabinan were found in the B. velezensis 157 genome. Thus, the  study of B. velezensis 157 broadened that B. velezensis can not only be used as  biocontrol agents, but also has potentially a wide range of applications in  lignocellulosic biomass conversion.},

Bone formation is a complex  process in which osteoblast differentiation plays an important role. This study  aimed to investigate the promotion effects of aucubin on osteoblast  differentiation in MG63\,cells, a human osteoblast-like cell line. Aucubin not  only improved osteoblast differentiation, as shown by enhanced ALP (alkaline  phosphatase) concentration and mineralization in cells, but increased the  expression of various cytokines, including collagen I, osteocalcin, osteopontin,  integrin {$\beta$}1, and Osterix. Aucubin strongly enhanced the levels of BMP2 (bone  morphogenetic proteins-2) in MG63\,cells, which play a central role during  osteoblast differentiation. Further data show that aucubin exposure after 1 day,  7 days, and 14 days enhanced the expression of Smad1, 5, and 8, and the  phosphoresced levels of MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) family Erk  (extracellular signal-regulated kinases), JNK (c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinases), P38,  and Akt (serine/threonine protein kinase)/mTOR (mammalian target of  rapamycin)/p70s6k in MG63\,cells. This study shows the improved effects of aucubin  on osteoblast differentiation in MG63\,cells, related to the signaling of  BMP2-mediated Smads (drosophila mothers against decapentaplegic proteins), MAPKs,  and Akt/mTOR/p70S6K.

The results show that the E. ulmoides seed contained about  34.63\% oil. The excellent physicochemical properties of E. ulmoides seed oil  ensured it has a potential to be developed as an edible oil. The main fatty acids  in E. ulmoides seed oil were linolenic acid (61.36\%), oleic acid (17.02\%), and  linoleic acid (12.04\%). HPLC-ELSD method determined that LnLnLn (37.99\%), LnLnO  (22.62\%), LnLnL (14.5\%), and LnLnP (8.78\%) were the oil's major TAG components.  The oil exhibited a unique thermal curve which contained 2 melting peaks at  -38.45 and -22.22 \textdegree C, respectively. The total content of vitamin E in E. ulmoides  seed oil was 190.96 mg/100g, which exist mainly in {$\gamma$}-tocopherol and {$\delta$}-tocopherol  isomer.

Functional characterization of EuWRI1 was  elucidated through seed-specific expression in tobacco. In transgenic tobacco,  the expression of EuWRI1 in eight independent transgenic lines was detected by  semiquantitative RT-PCR. The relative mRNA accumulation of genes encoding enzymes  involved in fatty acid biosynthesis (biotin carboxyl carrier protein and keto-ACP  synthase 1) was also assayed in tobacco seeds. Analysis of the seeds oil content  and starch content indicated that the transgenic lines showed a significant  increase in seeds oil content, whereas starch content decreased significantly.  Further analysis of the fatty acid composition revealed that palmitic acid  (16:0), linoleic acid (18:2) and linolenic acid (18:3) increased significantly in  seeds of transgenic tobacco lines, but stearic acid (18:0) levels significantly  declined. \textcopyright{} 2018 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides, also called hardy rubber tree, is an economically important tree; however, the lack~of its genome sequence restricts the fundamental  biological research and applied studies of this plant species. Here, we present a  high-quality assembly of its {$\sim$}1.2-Gb genome (scaffold N50~=~1.88 Mb) with at  least 26~723 predicted genes for E. ulmoides, the first sequenced genome of the  order Garryales, which was obtained using an integrated strategy combining  Illumina sequencing, PacBio sequencing, and BioNano mapping. As a sister taxon to  lamiids and campanulids, E. ulmoides underwent an ancient genome triplication  shared by core eudicots but no further whole-genome duplication~in the last {$\sim$}125  million years. E. ulmoides exhibits high expression levels and/or gene number  expansion for multiple genes involved in stress responses and the biosynthesis of  secondary metabolites, which may account for its considerable environmental  adaptability. In contrast to the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), which produces  cis-polyisoprene, E. ulmoides has evolved to synthesize long-chain  trans-polyisoprene via farnesyl diphosphate synthases (FPSs). Moreover, FPS and  rubber elongation factor/small rubber particle protein gene families were  expanded independently from the H. brasiliensis lineage. These results provide  new insights into the biology of E.~ulmoides and the origin of polyisoprene  biosynthesis.},

To select the suitable processing method and  "sweating" processing condition for Eucommiae Cortex, in this study, the quality  of Eucommiae Cortex was evaluated based on simultaneous determination of multiple  bioactive constituents combined with gray relational analysis. The contents of  lignans, iridoids, penylpropanoids, flavonoids, and phenols in samples were  simultaneously determined using ultra-fast performance liquid chromatography  coupled with triple quadrupole-linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry. The  chromatographic separation was performed on a Synergiۛ Hydro-RP 100 \AA{} column  (100~mm~\texttimes ~2.0~mm, 2.5~{$\mu$}m) at 30\textdegree C with a gradient elution of acetonitrile with  0.1\% formic acid/0.1\% aqueous formic acid as the mobile phase. Furthermore, gray  relational analysis was performed to evaluate and sort the samples according to  the contents of 14 constituents by calculating the relative correlation degree of  each sample. The results demonstrated that the quality of Eucommiae Cortex  "sweating" at source area was better and the better "sweating" condition was to  scrape off the cork layer before "sweating" with straw covering and sun drying.  The developed method could provide the foundation and support for "sweating"  processing method of Eucommiae Cortex in normalization and standardization.},

Endothelial dysfunction, which  is caused by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling, is an initial  step in atherosclerosis. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of  EUL aqueous extract against ox-LDL-induced eNOS uncoupling and its possible  mechanisms in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). A EUL component,  aucubin, was also applied to ox-LDL-exposed HUVECs. Whereas ox-LDL significantly  decreased nitric oxide (NO) levels in HUVECs, EUL extract and aucubin led to  significant recovery of NO levels. When treated with ox-LDL in the presence of  EUL extracts or aucubin, O(2)(-) production was markedly reduced in HUVECs  compared to treatment with ox-LDL alone. EUL extract and aucubin also led to  recovery of phospho-eNOS Thr495 expression, a critical signaling component in  eNOS uncoupling, suggesting that EUL has regulatory effects against eNOS  uncoupling and might play preventive/regulatory roles against vascular  endothelial dysfunction.},

Baill (SC), Lycium chinense Mill (LC) and Eucommia ulmoides Oliv (EU) are representative tonic  herbal medicines that help to strengthen body muscles and bones making them  stronger according to the Donguibogam, a tradition medical book of the Joseon  Dynasty in Korea. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate effects of an herbal formula  consisting of SC, LC and EU on muscle atrophy in C2C12 myotubes and in a rat  model of immobilization-induced muscle atrophy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Muscle  atrophy was developed by cast immobilization of unilateral hindlimb on rats for 3  weeks. Treatments were administered orally 14 times over 3 weeks. After  treatments, we compared the change of body weight, muscle weight, grip strength,  muscle fiber size, muscle fiber type shift by Grip strength meter, H\&E stain and  ATPase stain. And western blot was used for evaluating molecular mechanism in  muscle atrophy on C2C12 cells. RESULTS: When taken individually, SC was the most  effective of the three in inhibiting tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-{$\alpha$})-induced  degeneration of C2C12 myogenesis. The formulation with a mass ratio of 2:1:1 SC:  LC: EU (SSLE) was more effective against TNF-{$\alpha$}-induced muscle atrophy than was a  1:1:1 SC: LC: EU (SLE) formula or any of the single herbal extracts. In a rat  model of disuse muscle atrophy, the SSLE formula significantly inhibited  reductions in muscle weight, grip strength and muscle fiber size induced by  hindlimb immobilization, in a dose-dependent manner. The formula also inhibited  immobilization-induced shifting of the muscle fiber type in soleus muscle.  Treatment with SSLE inhibited TNF-{$\alpha$}-induced expression of the atrogenes atrogin-1  and muscle RING-finger protein 1 in C2C12 cells. The SSLE formula also increased  myoblast differentiation markers (myoD and myogenin) and activation of the Akt  and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: These  findings suggest that the SSLE formula prevents muscle atrophy through inhibition  of the ubiquitin-proteasome system as well as upregulation of myoblast  differentiation and muscle protein synthesis in C2C12 cells. Taken together, we  conclude that the SSLE formula is invaluable for the development of therapeutic  medicines to prevent disuse muscle atrophy and its accompanying muscle weakness.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Due to its excellent adsorption capability, activated carbon(AC) has also been employed as a drug carrier. However, applications of the AC carrier in  traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have been rare. We selected the Eucommia  ulmoides leaf extract as the drug of choice and AC as its carrier, to investigate  the adsorption and sustained release behavior of the Eucommia ulmoides leaf  extract on the AC. METHODS: AC was employed in this study as the sustained  release carrier and its capability for adsorption and sustained release of  Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts was systematically investigated. Acid or alkali  modified AC was assessed for its ability to absorb and sustain release of  Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts according to a variety of adsorption/release rate  and composition. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the adsorption rate for the  differently modified AC reached above 80 \%, whereas the adsorption of Eucommia  ulmoides leaf extracts on the AC was selective. The composition of the sustained  release liquid, which was treated by the acid modified AC, was almost similar to  the original extract. The acid modified AC was therefore taken as an optimal  carrier that can be used for Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts sustained release.  CONCLUSION: The synchronous release and absorption of different ingredients in  the active ingredient release process ensures the global and cooperative effect  with sustained and less toxic advantages. The ideal synchronous release is that  the absorbed component proportion is consistent with its release. The acid  modified AC was therefore taken as the optimal carrier that can be used for  Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts sustained release.},

  abstract = {The annotation of small molecules is one of the most challenging and important steps in untargeted mass spectrometry analysis, as most of our biological interpretations rely on structural annotations. Molecular networking has emerged as a structured way to organize and mine data from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments and has been widely applied to propagate annotations. However, propagation is done through manual inspection of MS/MS spectra connected in the spectral networks and is only possible when a reference library spectrum is available. One of the alternative approaches used to annotate an unknown fragmentation mass spectrum is through the use of in silico predictions. One of the challenges of in silico annotation is the uncertainty around the correct structure among the predicted candidate lists. Here we show how molecular networking can be used to improve the accuracy of in silico predictions through propagation of structural annotations, even when there is no match to a MS/MS spectrum in spectral libraries. This is accomplished through creating a network consensus of re-ranked structural candidates using the molecular network topology and structural similarity to improve in silico annotations. The Network Annotation Propagation (NAP) tool is accessible through the GNPS web-platform https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-theoretical.jsp.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Metabolites, small molecules that are involved in cellular reactions, provide a direct functional signature of cellular state. Untargeted metabolomics experiments usually rely on tandem mass spectrometry to identify the thousands of compounds in a biological sample. Recently, we presented CSI:FingerID for searching in molecular structure databases using tandem mass spectrometry data. CSI:FingerID predicts a molecular fingerprint that encodes the structure of the query compound, then uses this to search a molecular structure database such as PubChem. Scoring of the predicted query fingerprint and deterministic target fingerprints is carried out assuming independence between the molecular properties constituting the fingerprint. Results: We present a scoring that takes into account dependencies between molecular properties. As before, we predict posterior probabilities of molecular properties using machine learning. Dependencies between molecular properties are modeled as a Bayesian tree network; the tree structure is estimated on the fly from the instance data. For each edge, we also estimate the expected covariance between the two random variables. For fixed marginal probabilities, we then estimate conditional probabilities using the known covariance. Now, the corrected posterior probability of each candidate can be computed, and candidates are ranked by this score. Modeling dependencies improves identification rates of CSI:FingerID by 2.85 percentage points. Availability and implementation: The new scoring Bayesian (fixed tree) is integrated into SIRIUS 4.0 (https://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/software/sirius/).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sepsis-induced metabolic disturbances include hyperlactatemia, disruption of glycolysis, protein catabolism, and altered fatty acid metabolism. It may also lower serum L-carnitine that supports the use of L-carnitine supplementation as a treatment to ameliorate several of these metabolic consequences. METHODS: To further understand the association between L-carnitine-induced changes in serum acylcarnitines, fatty acid metabolism and survival, serum samples from (T0), 12{$\mkern1mu$}hfollowing completion (T24) of L-carnitine (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}16) or placebo (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}15) administration, and 48{$\mkern1mu$}h (T48) after enrollment from patients with septic shock enrolled in a randomized control trial were assayed for acylcarnitines, free fatty acids, and insulin. Data were analyzed comparing 1-year survivors and nonsurvivors within treatment groups. RESULTS: Mortality was 8 of 16 (50\%) and 12 of 15 (80\%) at 1 year for L-carnitine and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Free carnitine, C2, C3, and C8 acylcarnitines were higher among nonsurvivors at enrollment. L-Carnitine treatment increased levels of all measured acylcarnitines; an effect that was sustained for at least 36{$\mkern1mu$}h following completion of the infusion and was more prominent among nonsurvivors. Several fatty acids followed a similar, though less consistent pattern. Glucose, lactate, and insulin levels did not differ based on survival or treatment arm. CONCLUSIONS: In human patients with septic shock, L-Carnitine supplementation increases a broad range of acylcarnitine concentrations that persist after cessation of infusion, demonstrating both immediate and sustained effects on the serum metabolome. Nonsurvivors demonstrate a distinct metabolic response to L-carnitine compared with survivors, which may indicate preexisting or more profound metabolic derangement that constrains any beneficial response to treatment.},

  abstract = {Liver X receptors {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} (LXR{$\alpha$} and LXR{$\beta$}) are nuclear receptors with pivotal roles in the transcriptional control of lipid metabolism. Transcriptional activity of LXRs is induced in response to elevated cellular levels of cholesterol. LXRs bind to and regulate the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in cholesterol absorption, transport, efflux, excretion and conversion to bile acids. The coordinated, tissue-specific actions of the LXR pathway maintain systemic cholesterol homeostasis and regulate immune and inflammatory responses. LXRs also regulate fatty acid metabolism by controlling the lipogenic transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and regulate genes that encode proteins involved in fatty acid elongation and desaturation. LXRs exert important effects on the metabolism of phospholipids, which, along with cholesterol, are major constituents of cellular membranes. LXR activation preferentially drives the incorporation of polyunsaturated fatty acids into phospholipids by inducing transcription of the remodelling enzyme lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 3. The ability of the LXR pathway to couple cellular sterol levels with the saturation of fatty acids in membrane phospholipids has implications for several physiological processes, including lipoprotein production, dietary lipid absorption and intestinal stem cell proliferation. Understanding how LXRs regulate membrane composition and function might provide new therapeutic insight into diseases associated with dysregulated lipid metabolism, including atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus and cancer.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, particularly the mechanisms whereby a minority of patients develop a more severe phenotype characterised by hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and fibrosis is still incompletely understood. Herein, we discuss two pivotal aspects of the pathogenesis of NASH. We first analyse the initial mechanisms responsible for hepatocellular damage and inflammation, which derive from the toxic effects of excess lipids. Accumulating data indicate that the total amount of triglycerides stored in hepatocytes is not the major determinant of lipotoxicity, and that specific lipid classes act as damaging agents on liver cells. In particular, the role of free fatty acids such as palmitic acid, cholesterol, lysophosphatidylcholine and ceramides has recently emerged. These lipotoxic agents affect the cell behaviour via multiple mechanisms, including activation of signalling cascades and death receptors, endoplasmic reticulum stress, modification of mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress. In the second part of this review, the cellular and molecular players involved in the cross-talk between the gut and the liver are considered. These include modifications to the microbiota, which provide signals through the intestine and bacterial products, as well as hormones produced in the bowel that affect metabolism at different levels including the liver. Finally, the activation of nuclear receptors by bile acids is analysed.},

Increased awareness of the condition resulting from ongoing campaigns and the evidence arising from research in the past 10 years have increased understanding of this problem among clinicians and lay people, and have led to improved outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and have adopted a resolution to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed. Sepsis is now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition codifies organ dysfunction using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score. Ongoing research aims to improve definition of patient populations to allow for individualised management strategies matched to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques that can facilitate this aim, and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by modifying the disease process. While waiting for this goal to be achieved, improved basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programmes offers the best hope of increasing favourable outcomes.},

  abstract = {Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) and conjugated linolenic acids (CLNAs) have gained significant attention due to their anticarcinogenic and lipid/energy metabolism-modulatory effects. However, their concentration in foodstuffs is insufficient for any therapeutic application to be implemented. From a biotechnological standpoint, microbial production of these conjugated fatty acids (CFAs) has been explored as an alternative, and strains of the genera Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium have shown promising producing capacities. Current screening research works are generally based on direct analytical determination of production capacity (e.g., trial and error), representing an important bottleneck in these studies. This review aims to summarize the available information regarding identified genes and proteins involved in CLA/CLNA production by these groups of bacteria and, consequently, the possible enzymatic reactions behind such metabolic processes. Linoleate isomerase (LAI) was the first enzyme to be described to be involved in the microbiological transformation of linoleic acids (LAs) and linolenic acids (LNAs) into CFA isomers. Thus, the availability of lai gene sequences has allowed the development of genetic screening tools. Nevertheless, several studies have reported that LAIs have significant homology with myosin-cross-reactive antigen (MCRA) proteins, which are involved in the synthesis of hydroxy fatty acids, as shown by hydratase activity. Furthermore, it has been suggested that CLA and/or CLNA production results from a stress response performed by the activation of more than one gene in a multiple-step reaction. Studies on CFA biochemical pathways are essential to understand and characterize the metabolic mechanism behind this process, unraveling all the gene products that may be involved. As some of these bacteria have shown modulation of lipid metabolism in vivo, further research to be focused on this topic may help us to understand the role of the gut microbiota in human health.},

By investigating of various variables, including  MTT, temperature, inhibitors, pH, salt concentration and herb processing methods,  we tried to clarify whether the salt-processing on herbs was necessary or not.  Results showed that, compared to other processing methods, the salt-frying  process significantly (p {$<$} 0.01) enhanced the absorption of effective components  of Qing'e Pills. The way that psoralen, isopsoralen, psoralenoside and geniposide  acid entered Caco-2 cells at low concentrations was via passive diffusion. These  components were not substrates of P-glycoprotein. It demonstrated that the  salt-frying process not only enhanced the concentration of active components in  herb extract, but also changed their absorption behaviors. Nevertheless, the  mechanism of absorption behavior changing needs to be further investigated.},

Although natural product extracts have been  reported to have anti-osteoarthritic effects, the potential bioactivity of  Ryupunghwan (RPH), a traditional Korean medicinal botanical formula that contains  Astragalus membranaceus, Turnera diffusa, Achyranthes bidentata, Angelica gigas,  Eclipta prostrata, Eucommia ulmoides, and Ilex paraguariensis, is not known well.  Therefore, the inhibitory effects of single compounds isolated from RPH on the  OA-related molecules were investigated using IL-1{$\beta$}-stimulated chondrosarcoma  SW1353 (SW1353) cell model. Two bioactive compounds, isomucronulatol  7-O-{$\beta$}-d-glucoside (IMG) and ecliptasaponin A (ES) were isolated and purified from  RPH using column chromatography, and then the structures were analyzed using  ESI-MS, {$^1$}H-NMR, and (13)C-NMR spectrum. The expression or amount of matrix  metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), COX1/2, TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$} or p65 was determined by  RT-PCR, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RPH  pretreatment reduced the expression and amounts of MMP13, and the expression of  collagen II, COX1/2, TNF-{$\alpha$}, IL-1{$\beta$} or p65, which were increased in  IL-1{$\beta$}-stimulated SW1353 cells. IMG reduced the expression of all OA-related  molecules, but the observed inhibitory effect was less than that of RPH extract.  The other single compound ES showed the reduced expression of all OA-related  molecules, and the effect was stronger than that in IMG (approximately 100 fold).  Combination pretreatment of both single components remarkably reduced the  expression of MMP13, compared to each single component. These synergic effects  may provide potential molecular modes of action for the anti-osteoarthritic  effects of RPH observed in clinical and animal studies.},

Among the nine kinds of macroporous  resins investigated, the HPD850 resin was found to be the most suitable.  Equilibrium adsorption tests were investigated and found to be better fitted by  the Langmuir isotherm model. After the dynamic tests on a column packed with  HPD850, the optimum operational conditions were as follows: for the absorption  process, an initial aucubin concentration of 9.87 mg/L, a sample volume of 13 bed  volumes (BV), and a flow rate of 2 BV/h; for the water washing process, 5 BV of  deionized water and a flow rate of 3 BV/h; for the ethanol desorption process, a  10{$^-$}80\% ethanol volume fraction as the eluent, 2 BV for each ethanol volume  fraction, and a flow rate of 3 BV/h. The 40{$^-$}80\% ethanol volume fraction eluent  was collected and concentrated to produce the final products, resulting in an  aucubin purity and recovery of 79.41\% and 72.92\%, respectively.},

The method relied on the use of single cellulase to  the extract and hydrolyze geniposide, which is performed continuously in the same  system; genipin is easy in preparation with exempting the isolation and  purification of geniposide. The mechanism of ILEIH procedure was discussed in  detail to illustrate the advantage of ILEIH in the extraction process. 0.5\,mol/L  [C6mim]Cl aqueous solution was selected as extraction solvent. The optimum  conditions of 140\,min treatment time, 19.81\,mL/g liquid-solid ratio, 5.15\,mg/mL  enzyme concentration and 5.0\,pH value for the ILEIH process were obtained after  investigating by single factor experiments and Box-Benhnken design in terms of  the genipin increment. And the first-order kinetic model based on {$\beta$}-glucosidase  in the three reaction medium were established to study their impacts on the  reaction rate. The proposed ILEIH method was validated by stability,  repeatability, and recovery experiments and shows reliable data in the extraction  and hydrolysis process. Therefore, this proposed approach is promising for the  in-situ production of genipin and should be potentially applied to the obtaining  of other active aglycons.},

This study introduces a simple online extraction strategy  coupled with high-speed counter-current chromatography for efficient extraction  and purification of bioactive components from solid natural products.

Bioactive components were directly extracted by  the mobile phase of high-speed counter-current chromatography, and then  transferred into high-speed counter-current chromatography for purification. In  addition, the compatibility of the developed methodology for direct purification  of bioactive components from fresh M. officinalis was successfully demonstrated.  Obviously, in comparison with traditional offline heat-reflux extraction, online  extraction avoided the instrument, time, solvent, and energy consumption, and  purified two phenolic compounds (honokiol and magnolol) from M. officinalis and  three alkaloids (piperyline, piperine, and piperanine) from P. nigrum with high  extraction efficiency. The superiority of the developed methodology is to  establish an easy, rapid, and efficient technique for the purification of a wide  variety of bioactive components from solid natural products.},

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. is widely regarded in China as a precious medicinal and commercial endemic tree. Due to cross-breeding or natural variation of E.  ulmoides, the metabolite composition may vary significantly, making control of  the medical quality difficult. In order to improve the rational development and  utilization, the quality of seven varieties of E. ulmoides were evaluated based  on metabolite profiles (total phenolic, total flavonoid, gutta-percha, aucubin,  geniposidic acid, chlorogenic acid, geniposide, pinoresinol diglucoside, rutin,  hyperoside, and astragalin), bioactivities (in vitro, in vivo antioxidant  activities, and antibacterial activities) and HPLC fingerprint combined with  chemometrics analysis. On this basis, the differences of medicinal parts (leaf  and bark) were further carried out. For the traditional use of bark, Purple-leaf  E. ulmoides was the most suitable. For the use of leaf, Qinzhong 1 and  Purple-leaf E. ulmoides were appropriate. HPLC fingerprint analysis showed that  significant differences in metabolite profiles exist among seven varieties of E.  ulmoides. Combined with chemometrics analysis, seven varieties of E. ulmoides  were divided into three groups from the use of leaf and bark. The analysis not  only evaluated quality of seven varieties of E. ulmoides, but also could  distinguish different varieties and different regions of origin. The results can  provide theoretical basis for E. ulmoides resources utilization and cultivation  of fine varieties.},

AUC treatment  rescued the decreased dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase levels in the striatum of  parkinsonian mice. Furthermore, AUC treatment reduced both microglia and  astrocyte activation in the substantia nigra of parkinsonian mice.

Here, we attempted to explore the protect effects of Ai on  LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Our results indicated that Ai increased the  survival rate and ameliorated pathogenic processes in lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)-induced mice. However, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)  deletion may impede protective effect of Ai. Additionally, Ai reduced oxidative  stress by down-regulating malondialdehyde (MDA) and O(2){$\cdot$} activity, and enhancing  Nrf2-targeted signals, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and quinone  oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1). Also, Ai inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines and  phosphorylated-nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) expression in LPS-administrated mice.  However, these protective effects of Ai were suppressed in Nrf2-knockout mice.  Importantly, Nrf2-deficiency showed no effects on phosphorylated AMP-activated  protein kinase (p-AMPK) expression in mice treated with LPS and Ai. Similarly, in  LPS-induced macrophages, Ai reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation,  elevated NQO-1 and HO-1 expression. LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and  p-NF-{$\kappa$}B were reversed by Ai. Of note, we found that Ai-induced Nrf2 activation  was dependent on AMPK activation. Suppression of AMPK levels may inhibit Nrf2  activation, finally leading to up regulation of inflammatory response and  oxidative stress. Thus, our findings indicated the crosstalk between Nrf2 and  AMPK signaling pathways, and the interaction was essential for the anti-oxidant  and anti-inflammatory effects of Ai in LPS-induced macrophages, which might be  beneficial for finding new treatments against ALI.},

A computational simulation by evaluation of electronic binding energy is  used to optimize the stoichiometric ratio between CGA and 4-VP (1:5), which  reduced the duration of laboratory trials. The porous MIP shell and the rid of  solid MIPs by magnet gave MPMIPs high binding capacity (42.22 mg/g) and fast  kinetic binding (35 min). Adsorption behavior between CGA and MPMIPs followed  Langmuir equation and pseudo-first-order reaction kinetics.

Overall, this study provided an  efficient approach for fabrication of well-constructed MPMIPs for fast and  selective recognition and determination of CGA from complex samples.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence indicates that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in regulatory networks controlling plant and animal gene expression.  However, lncRNA roles in regulating rubber biosynthesis in Eucommia ulmoides, an  emerging source of natural rubber (Eu-rubber), are currently unknown. Here, we  report on RNA deep-sequencing of E. ulmoides fruits at two developmental stages.  Based on application of a stringent pipeline, 29,103 lncRNAs and 9,048  transcripts of uncertain coding potential (TUCPs) were identified. Two  differentially expressed (DE) TUCPs appear to simultaneously regulate 12  protein-coding genes involved in Eu-rubber biosynthesis (GIEBs), as well as 95 DE  genes. Functional categorization of these 95 DE genes indicated their involvement  in subcellular microstructures and cellular processes, such as cell wall, cell  division, and growth. These DE genes may participate in the differentiation and  development of laticifers, where Eu-rubber is synthesized. A model is proposed in  which "commanders" (DE TUCPs) direct the "builders" (DE genes) to construct a  "storehouse" of materials needed for Eu-rubber synthesis, and the "workers"  (GIEBs) to synthesize Eu-rubber. These findings provide insights into both cis-  and trans-polyisoprene biosynthesis in plants, laying the foundation for  additional studies of this crucial process.},

  abstract = {Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a refractory disease that causes chronic inflammation or ulceration in the mucosa of the large intestine with multiple relapses.  Although several drugs, including 5-aminosalicylic acid, steroids,  immunosuppressants, and infliximab, are used for UC therapy, patients suffer from  side effects of these drugs, and a new safer therapeutic agent is desired.  Eucommia ulmoides OLIV. leaf extract (ELE) has an anti-inflammatory effect.  Therefore, we examined the effect of ELE on UC using a chronic dextran sulfate  sodium (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice. Chronic DSS-induced colitis was  triggered by alternately repeating 5 days' DSS and 7 days' water administration  in mice for 29\,d. The severity of DSS-induced colitis was evaluated by daily body  weight and bloody stool score, and colon length and myeloperoxidase (MPO)  activity in colon tissue on day 29. ELE (3 or 9\%) was administered in combination  by feeding for 29\,d, and the effect on colitis was evaluated. The mice given DSS  exhibited chronic colitis symptoms with body weight loss, increased bloody stool  score and MPO activity, and shortened colon length. Administration of 3 or 9\% ELE  suppressed the body weight loss, bloody stool score, colon shortening, and MPO  activity in a dose-dependent manner. Histological analysis showed that the  ELE-treated mice had less damages and leukocyte infiltration in the mucosal layer  of the large intestine compared to DSS alone group. These results suggested that  ELE has the potential to prevent the development of DSS-induced colitis and a  therapeutic effect on UC in a safe manner.},

Yet, metabolite annotation remains a key challenge. Recently, molecular networking and MS2LDA emerged as molecular mining tools that find molecular families and substructures in mass spectrometry fragmentation data. Moreover,             in silico             annotation tools obtain and rank candidate molecules for fragmentation spectra. Ideally, all structural information obtained and inferred from these computational tools could be combined to increase the resulting chemical insight one can obtain from a data set. However, integration is currently hampered as each tool has its own output format and efficient matching of data across these tools is lacking. Here, we introduce MolNetEnhancer, a workflow that combines the outputs from molecular networking, MS2LDA,             in silico             annotation tools (such as Network Annotation Propagation or DEREPLICATOR) and the automated chemical classification through ClassyFire to provide a more comprehensive chemical overview of metabolomics data whilst at the same time illuminating structural details for each fragmentation spectrum. We present examples from four plant and bacterial case studies and show how MolNetEnhancer enables the chemical annotation, visualization, and discovery of the subtle substructural diversity within molecular families. We conclude that MolNetEnhancer is a useful tool that greatly assists the metabolomics researcher in deciphering the metabolome through combination of multiple independent             in silico             pipelines.},

  abstract = {Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus. Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. is used as a traditional medicine for male impotence, but no  systematic study has examined its effect on diabetes-associated ED. In this  study, we investigated the effects of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaf extract (EULE)  on restoring erectile function in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats  model. After 16 weeks of treatment, EULE administration had significantly  increased intracavernosal pressure, nitric oxide (NO) levels, and cyclic  guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentrations. Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD)  and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels were markedly higher and serum  malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were lower in the EULE-treated groups than in the  diabetic model group. EULE restored NO biosynthesis by significantly increasing  protein kinase B (Akt) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activation.  Furthermore, EULE is likely to benefit the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG)  axis, as it increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating  hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone (T) concentrations as  well as hormone receptors Gnrhr, Fshr, and Lhr expression levels. Hence, EULE  attenuates oxidative stress, increases NO production, and activates the Akt-eNOS  pathway to restore endothelial function; moreover, EULE enhances the HPG axis to  improve erectile function. These results suggest that EULE may represent a new  therapeutic avenue for diabetes-associated ED.},

  abstract = {Aucubin (AUB), which is extracted from Eucommia ulmoides Oliver seeds, has been found to possess anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic properties. Recent studies  have indicated that inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis are involved in  the pathophysiology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac dysfunction. Our  study aimed to investigate the effect of AUB on LPS-induced acute cardiac injury.  Male C57BL/6 mice were injected with LPS (one 6 mg/kg injection) to induce  cardiac dysfunction without or with AUB pretreatment (20 or 80 mg/kg per day) for  1 week. We found that AUB ameliorated cardiac dysfunction, inflammation,  oxidative stress, and apoptosis induced by LPS stimulation. Mechanistically, AUB  inhibited LPS-induced oxidative stress by decreasing reactive oxygen species and  thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) levels. Moreover, AUB suppressed  LPS-induced inflammation and apoptosis by reducing nucleotide-binding  oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3  (NLRP3)/apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment  domain (ASC)/caspase-1 inflammasome formation. Overexpression of NLRP3 in  cardiomyocytes attenuated the protective effects of AUB. Interestingly, NLRP3  deficiency ameliorated cardiac function and reduced the inflammatory response and  oxidative stress after LPS insult in mice, whereas AUB could not further prevent  LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction in NLRP3-deficient mice. In summary, AUB exerts a  protective effect against LPS-induced inflammation, oxidative stress, and  apoptosis in vivo and in vitro by regulating the TXNIP pathway and inactivating  the NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 inflammasome. Hence, AUB may be a promising agent against  LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Aucubin exerts a  protective effect against lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac dysfunction by  regulating nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin  domain-containing 3 inflammasome.},

Eucommia  ulmoides polysaccharide (EUP) was proved to be an effective biomaterial that has  immunomodulatory effects for improving the biomechanical quality of bone.  Strontium is a trace element that inhibits inflammation and promotes bone growth.  To develop a novel EUP-based osteoimmunomodulatory biomaterial with potentially  enhanced bone regeneration, we synthesized strontium Eucommia ulmoides  polysaccharides (EUP-Sr) and evaluated its morphology, structure and thermal  stability. The materials characterization results confirmed that strontium was  successfully introduced into the EUP and formed a new complex with thermal-stable  property. The cytocompatibility evaluation of different concentrations of EUP-Sr  by CCK8 assay suggested that EUP-Sr is beneficial to the macrophages  proliferation. We further evaluated the gene expressions of RAW 264.7 cells  treated with EUP-Sr. It was found that EUP-Sr could suppress inflammatory factors  and osteoclastogenesis, and enhance the expressions of osteogenic factors of RAW  264.7 cells. Therefore, EUP-Sr should be a promising bioactive compound with the  capability to create a positive pro-regenerative environment for skeleton tissue  engineering.},

As a strategic material, Eu-rubber plays a vital  role in general and defence industries. However, the study of Eu-rubber  biosynthesis at a molecular level is scarce, and the regulatory network between  microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in Eu-rubber biosynthesis has not  been assessed. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the transcriptomes,  small RNAs (sRNAs) and degradome to reveal the regulatory network of Eu-rubber  biosynthesis in E. ulmoides. A total of 82,065 unigenes and 221 miRNAs were  identified using high-throughput sequencing; 20,815 targets were predicted using  psRNATarget software. Of these targets, 779 miRNA-target pairs were identified  via degradome sequencing. Thirty-one miRNAs were differentially expressed; 22  targets of 34 miRNAs were annotated in the terpenoid backbone biosynthesis  pathway (ko00900) based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).  These miRNAs were putatively related to Eu-rubber biosynthesis. A regulatory  network was constructed according to the expression profiles of miRNAs and their  targets. These results provide a comprehensive analysis of transcriptomics, sRNAs  and degradome to reveal the Eu-rubber accumulation, and provide new insights into  genetic engineering techniques which may improve the content of Eu-rubber in E.  ulmoides.},

However, the  categories of metabolites, dynamic changes in metabolite accumulation and overall  molecular mechanisms involved in metabolite biosynthesis during E. ulmoides leaf  growth and development remain unknown. Here, a total of 515 analytes, including  127 flavonoids, 46 organic acids, 44 amino acid derivatives, 9 phenolamides, and  16 vitamins, were identified from four E. ulmoides samples using ultraperformance  liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) (for widely targeted  metabolites). The accumulation of most flavonoids peaked in growing leaves,  followed by old leaves. UPLC-MS analysis indicated that CGA accumulation  increased steadily to a high concentration during leaf growth and development,  and rutin showed a high accumulation level in leaf buds and growing leaves. Based  on single-molecule long-read sequencing technology, 69,020 transcripts and 2880  novel loci were identified in E. ulmoides. Expression analysis indicated that  isoforms in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and flavonoid metabolic pathway  were highly expressed in growing leaves and old leaves. Co-expression network  analysis suggested a potential direct link between the flavonoid and  phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways via the regulation of transcription  factors, including MYB (v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog) and  bHLH (basic/helix-loop-helix).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eucommia ulmoides has been used for many years as a successful strategy to treat male infertility. Aucubin (AU) is the active ingredient  extracted from Eucommia ulmoides. However, its protective action and exact  mechanism on testicular injury is not yet known. PURPOSE: Here, the protective  effect and the mechanism of action of AU on testis damage under oxidative stress  was investigated in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: As regard the in vivo experiment,  male mice were divided into five groups and testicular injury model was  established by Triptolide (TP) (120\,{$\mu$}g/kg) intraperitoneal injection for two  weeks. Animals in the treatment group were pretreated with an intraperitoneal  injection of AU at different doses (5, 10 and 20\,mg/kg) for 1\,h and subsequently  treated with TP (120\,{$\mu$}g/kg). At the end of the experimental period, the testis  was collected for biochemical and histological examination. As regard the in  vitro experiment, Sertoli cells (SCs) were used to investigate the protective  effect and mechanism of action of AU against disruption of the  blood-testis-barrier (BTB) and apoptosis induced by TP via apoptosis detection,  western blot, immunofluorescence analysis, and siRNA transient transfection.  RESULTS: TP-treated animals showed testicular atrophy, BTB disruption, increased  ROS levels and spermatogenic dysfunction. Pre-administration of AU resulted in a  significant protection on keeping a normal testicular weight, sperm morphology,  BTB integrity, and a normal level of oxidative stress markers and antioxidants.  Furthermore, AU prevented apoptosis through an effective inhibition of PERK/CHOP  and JNK dependent apoptosis pathway, as well as protected the integrity of BTB by  up-regulating the expression of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, Occludin,  Claudin-11) and gap junction protein (Cx43). The mechanistic study revealed that  AU significantly triggered Nrf2 translocation, thus increasing nuclear Nrf2  accumulation and then induced antioxidant enzymes expression in the testis and  SCs. Furthermore, Nrf2 silencing unsuccessfully reversed the increased CHOP and  p-JNK expression induced by TP, abolishing the protective effect of AU.  CONCLUSION: These results indicate that AU might be considered as a potential  protective agent against testicular injury.},

We assessed the  uncertainty of carbon fixation and plant growth predictions by modeling three  growth phases with corresponding parameters: (i) before afforestation using  default parameters, (ii) early monitoring using parameters optimized with data  from years 1 to 5, and (iii) updated monitoring at year 11 using parameters  optimized with 11-year data. The predicted carbon fixation and optimized  parameters differed in the three phases. Overall, 30-year average carbon fixation  rate in plantation (AC, LC, belowground woody parts and soil pools) was ranged  0.14-0.35~kg-C~m(-2)~y(-1) in simulations using parameters of phases (i)-(iii).  Updating parameters by periodic field surveys reduced the uncertainty and  revealed changes in ecophysiological characteristics with plant growth. This  monitoring method should support management of afforestation projects by carbon  fixation estimation adapting to observation gap, noncommon species and variable  growing conditions such as climate change, land use change.},

Chemical investigation of an EtOAc extract of a  deep-sea-derived Penicillium sp. led to the isolation of three new cyclopiane  diterpenes, namely, conidiogenols C-D (1-2) and conidiogenone L (3). The  structures were determined by extensive analyses of the spectroscopic data in  association with ECD calculations and chemical conversion for configurational  assignments. Compound 1 represents the second example of cyclopianes bearing a  hydroxyl group at C-13. Compound 2, the third example of conidiogenols, possesses  a distinct {$\alpha$}-oriented 1-hydroxy group relative to other analogues. The bioassay  study demonstrated that compounds 2 and 4-6 exhibited moderate inhibitory effects  against five esophageal cancer cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 25 to  55\,{$\mu$}M.

  abstract = {Background: As one of the most common and lethal malignant primary brain tumors, glioblastomas (GBMs) are identified as grade IV neoplasms, the most severe grade,  according to WHO classification systems. The outcome of surgery against GBMs is  limited since its frequent relapse. Radiotherapy is a crucial and widely used  treatment after surgery, while the strong radioresistance of GBM cells still  becomes a severe problem of radiotherapy. Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. is used for the  treatment of various diseases, such as lower blood pressure and inflammation.  Purpose: To explore the anti-tumor effect of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. against  GBMs. Methods: Dose-viability assays were performed to examine the anti-tumor  effect. Would-healing and transwell assays were carried out to evaluate the  migration and invasion ability of GBMs. Cell apoptosis was detected by 33, 258  staining, and the expressions of key proteins were examined by western blot.  Results: In this study, we confirmed that the inhibitory effect of the total  flavonoid of Eucommia ulmoides on proliferation, migration and invasion of human  GBM cells. Its favorable effects inspired us to explore the potential ability in  enhancing radiosensitivity of GBM cells. The results demonstrated that it could  further induce apoptosis during radiotherapy via intrinsic apoptosis pathway.  Besides, it could significantly reduce the malondialdehyde level after  radiotherapy, which suggested it inhibited tumor cell and protected normal  neuronal cells. By examining the expression of important genes of radioresistant  pathway, we found a significant decrease of HIF-{$\alpha$}/MMP-2 when using the total  flavonoid of Eucommia ulmoides during radiotherapy. Conclusion: This result  suggests that the enhancement of radiotherapy may be mediated by modulating  glucose metabolism of GBMs in HIF-{$\alpha$}/MMP-2 pathway.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Osteoporosis is one of the most common bone diseases; it is characterized by bone loss and is a risk factor for hip fracture.  Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) and their related natural compounds have been  used for treating many diseases, including bone diseases, since ancient times in  China and are regarded as a cost-effective complementary therapy. AIM OF THE  STUDY: The goal of this study was to investigate the osteoprotective mechanisms  of these three Chinese herbs and their related natural compounds. The effects of  CHMs and related natural compounds on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro  were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A network pharmacology method was  applied to study CHM-related natural compounds and their osteoporosis targets. In  addition, their effect on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7\,cells was  also investigated in vitro. RESULTS: Radix dipsaci, Eucommiae cortex, and Rhizoma  drynariae exhibited protective effects against mortality in hip fracture  patients. Furthermore, these three herbs inhibited RANKL-induced TRAP activities  and reduced the expression of bone resorption-related genes in RAW264.7\,cells.  Network analysis of natural compound (ingredient)-target interactions identified  11 natural compounds. Signal pathway analyses suggested that these compounds may  target cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, including RANKL-induced  osteoclastogenesis. Five novel natural compounds exhibited reduced RANKL-induced  TRAP activities and bone resorption-related gene expression. CONCLUSION: The  clinically used CHMs, Radix dipsaci, Eucommiae cortex, and Rhizoma drynariae, and  natural compounds obtained from them may suppress RANKL-induced  osteoclastogenesis in vitro.},

The mechanical properties, structural  characteristics and chemical composition of the scaffolds were investigated using  various materials characterization techniques. The results show that stiffness of  the scaffolds was in the same range as that of cartilage tissues with OA.  Confocal microscopy and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)  were performed to investigate the macrophages cultured on the scaffolds.  Significant morphological changes of cells were observed on PCL/EUG scaffolds  with different stiffness. The expression of inflammatory and fibrosis-related  cytokines increases as scaffold stiffness decreases, similar to the trend  observed in OA progression.},

Some components and contents of  barks and branches from E. ulmoides are similar, the barks are mainly used as  medicine, but the branches have not been systematically studied and were  discarded. In this paper, five fractions extracted from E. ulmoides branches were  detected by the classical anti-complement activity assay in vitro. The n-butanol  fraction of E. ulmoides branches showed excellent anti-complement activities with  a CH(50) value of 0.016\,{$\pm$}\,0.0014\,mg{$\cdot$}mL(-1). A total of 76 compounds were  identified from the n-butanol fraction, including 9 alkaloids, 18 organic acids,  22 lignans, 15 phenylethanoid glycosides and 12 other compounds. To further prove  the anti-complement activity of potential active compounds, those compounds  detectable in rat plasma after oral administration were tested by classical  anti-complement activity assays. Genipin and pinoresinol 4-O-glucopyranoside had  a certain complement inhibitory activity in the 17 potential anti-complements,  their CH(50) values were 0.050\,{$\pm$}\,0.0038 and 0.022\,{$\pm$}\,0.0018\,mg{$\cdot$}mL(-1).  UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS/MS was developed to profile and characterize the metabolites of  genipin and pinoresinol 4-O-glucopyranoside in rat plasma. Twenty-one and  seventeen metabolites were found, respectively. In summary, this study reported  important clues for the further pharmacological and clinical studies of E.  ulmoides branches.

  abstract = {Lasioderma serricorne, also known as cigarette beetle, can exploit a wide variety of stored materials as foods, but it is particularly common on tobacco and herbs.  This beetle is a dominant pest species of stored Chinese medicinal materials  (CMMs) causing high economic damages, making effective control strategies  urgently needed. Behavioural manipulation is an important component of Integrated  Pest Management. To the best of our knowledge, plant-borne volatile organic  compounds (VOCs) have never been explored to develop lures for managing L.  serricorne. In this study, the behavioural responses of L. serricorne to VOCs  from four selected CMMs (Euphorbia kansui, Aconitum carmichaelii, Eucommia  ulmoides and Pinellia ternata) were studied and their components analysed. Then,  the olfactory responses of L. serricorne to the most abundant VOC identified in  the preferred CMM, i.e., paeonal, was tested. L. serricorne showed significant  differences in its preferences for the VOCs from the four CMMs, i.e, E.  kansui\,{$>$}\,A. carmichaelii\,{$>$}\,E. ulmoides\,{$>$}\,P. ternata. From the VOCs of E. kansui,  A. carmichaelii, E. ulmoides, and P. ternata, 77, 74, 56, and 81 molecules, were  identified, respectively. Paeonal (23.5\%), junipene (17.2\%), hexanal (17.1\%), and  benzeneacetonitrile (14.0\%) were the most abundant, respectively. Since paeonal  dominated the VOC spectrum of the most preferred CMM, this compound was selected  for further studies. L. serricorne showed significant positive responses to  paeonal tested at various doses, with the most attractive ones being 100\,{$\mu$}g and  500\,{$\mu$}g. Our findings shed light on the olfactory cues routing the food searching  behaviour in the cigarette beetle, providing important information on how L.  serricorne targets particular CMMs. The high attractiveness of paeonal at low  doses tested here may be exploited further to develop novel monitoring and  control tools (e.g., lure-and-kill strategies) against this important stored  product pest.},

However, the comprehensive chemical analysis of  the formulated ARIF I has yet to be clarified. In this study, an ultra-high  performance liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap high  resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-orbitrap HRMS) method executed in full  scan/data-dependent MS(2) (full MS/dd-MS(2)) mode has been established in  negative ion mode to analyze the major chemical constituents in ARIF I as well as  in its three constituent herbs. To rapidly and efficient identify these  compounds, we employed a combination of statistical analysis of the MS(2) data  and fragmentation pathway method to screen for elementary characteristic ions and  sub-characteristic ions. Then, we applied multifold characteristic ion filtering  to comprehensively profile ARIF I extract chemical constituents with diverse  structures. A total of 360 compounds, including anthraquinones, sennosides,  galloyl glucoside derivatives, catechin and its derivatives, flavonoids,  iridoids, phenylpropanoids, lignan, organic acid, and other compounds were  rapidly identified or tentatively characterized by multifold characteristic ion  filtering based on their accurate mass spectra (within 5 ppm error) and structure  types or by comparison with reference standards. All the ARIF I compounds were  also detected in the individual constituent herbs. This study provides a basis  for further pharmacokinetic studies of ARIF I and may help in the discovery of  new chemical drugs to treat chronic kidney disease. This study also provides a  more efficient approach for the screening of appropriate characteristic ions, and  a practical strategy for the detection of the types of compounds identified in  this study in other herbal medicines.},

Socio-linguistic groups throughout China have traditionally used plants as  fermentation starters (or koji) for brewing traditional rice wine. The objective  of this study was to evaluate traditional knowledge, diversity, and values  regarding plants used as starters for brewing glutinous rice wine in the Dong  communities in the Guizhou Province of China, an area of rich biological and  cultural diversity. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were administered for  collecting ethnobotanical data on plants used as starters for brewing glutinous  rice wine in Dong communities. Field work was carried out in three communities in  Guizhou Province from September 2017 to July 2018. A total of 217 informants were  interviewed from the villages. RESULTS: A total of 60 plant species were  identified to be used as starters for brewing glutinous rice wine, belonging to  58 genera in 36 families. Asteraceae and Rosaceae are the most represented  botanical families for use as a fermentation starter for rice wine with 6 species  respectively, followed by Lamiaceae (4 species); Asparagaceae, Menispermaceae,  and Polygonaceae (3 species respectively); and Lardizabalaceae, Leguminosae,  Moraceae, Poaceae, and Rubiaceae (2 species, respectively). The other botanical  families were represented by one species each. The species used for fermentation  starters consist of herbs (60.0\%), shrubs (23.3\%), climbers (10.0\%), and trees  (6.7\%). The parts used include the root (21.7\%), leaf (20.0\%), and the whole  plant (16.7\%). Findings indicate a significant relationship between knowledge of  plants used as fermentation starters with age (P value {$<$}\,0.001) and educational  status (P value\,=\,0.004) but not with gender (P value\,=\,0.179) and occupation (P  value\,=\,0.059). The species that are most used by informants include Pueraria  lobata var. montana (Lour.) van der Maesen (UV\,=\,1.74; Leguminosae), Actinidia  eriantha Benth. (UV\,=\,1.51; Actinidiaceae), Oryza sativa L. var. glutinosa Matsum  (UV\,=\,1.5; Poaceae). CONCLUSION: This study highlights that while most of the  Dong informants continue to use a diverse range of plants as a fermentation  starter for brewing glutinous rice wine, knowledge of these plants is being lost  by the younger generations. Documentation of traditional ethnobotanical knowledge  and outreach is thus needed to conserve biocultural diversity in the rural Dong  communities in southern China.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As global climate change accelerates, ecologists and conservationists are increasingly investigating changes in biodiversity and predicting species  distribution based on species observed at sites, but rarely consider those plant  species that could potentially inhabit but are absent from these areas (i.e., the  dark diversity and its distribution). Here, we estimated the dark diversity of  vascular plants in China and picked up threatened dark species from the result,  and applied maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model to project current and future  distributions of those dark species in their potential regions (those regions  that have these dark species). METHODS: We used the Beals probability index to  estimate dark diversity in China based on available species distribution  information and explored which environmental variables had significant impacts on  dark diversity by incorporating bioclimatic data into the random forest (RF)  model. We collected occurrence data of threatened dark species (Eucommia  ulmoides, Liriodendron chinense, Phoebe bournei, Fagus longipetiolata,  Amentotaxus argotaenia, and Cathaya argyrophylla) and related bioclimatic  information that can be used to predict their distributions. In addition, we used  MaxEnt modeling to project their distributions in suitable areas under future  (2050 and 2070) climate change scenarios. RESULTS: We found that every study  region's dark diversity was lower than its observed species richness. In these  areas, their numbers of dark species are ranging from 0 to 215, with a generally  increasing trend from western regions to the east. RF results showed that  temperature variables had a more significant effect on dark diversity than those  associated with precipitation. The results of MaxEnt modeling showed that most  threatened dark species were climatically suitable in their potential regions  from current to 2070. DISCUSSIONS: The results of this study provide the first  ever dark diversity patterns concentrated in China, even though it was estimated  at the provincial scale. A combination of dark diversity and MaxEnt modeling is  an effective way to shed light on the species that make up the dark diversity,  such as projecting the distribution of specific dark species under global climate  change. Besides, the combination of dark diversity and species distribution  models (SDMs) may also be of value for ex situ conservation, ecological  restoration, and species invasion prevention in the future.},

We report the shape memory  properties of these blended materials with two response temperatures for the  first time. The mechanical, curing, thermal and shape memory properties of the  blends were studied in this manuscript. Schematic diagrams are proposed to  illustrate the dual shape memory behaviors of the EUG/LDPE blends. Our study  focused on observing the relationship between the shape memory behavior and the  microscopic crystalline phase states in the blends. In the blends, both the  cross-linked network and the LDPE crystalline regions could act as fixed domains,  while the crystalline regions of LDPE or EUG could act as the reversible domain.  The shape memory properties were mainly determined by the components of the fixed  and reversible domains. We focused on the shape memory behavior of blends at 60  \textdegree C and 130 \textdegree C in this manuscript. The results showed that when the peroxide  dicumyl peroxide (DCP) dosage was 1.0 phr, the blends exhibited acceptable shape  behavior at 60 \textdegree C (R(1f) = 74.8\%, R(1r) = 63.3\%). At the same time, when DCP  dosage was 0.4 phr, the shape memory behavior of the blends at 130 \textdegree C was good  and much better than that at 60 \textdegree C (R(2f) = 91.1\%, R(2r) = 89.4\%).},

The waste wood of Eucommia ulmoides  Oliver was pretreated and characterized for fuel applications. The results  confirm that both LTP and HTC are promising processes for improving fuel  properties. However, for the same char yield, the required temperature for HTC is  lower than LTP, as the char yields of H(200) and L(300) were quite close (66.50\%  vs. 66.74\%). The surface morphology is significantly different between the  pyrolytic carbon and the hydrochar. In addition, it was found that the H/C and  O/C ratios of H(300) were 0.82 and 0.21, respectively, and the H/C and O/C ratios  of L(340) were 0.77 and 0.22, respectively. They were similar to that of  sub-bituminous. Moreover, under the same reaction temperature, hydrochar showed  better grindability, hydrophobicity, and reduction in inorganic content.  Comparing the integrated combustion characteristic index (S), LTP process had the  better performance within the lower temperature under 220\,\textdegree C while HTC process  performed better at temperature higher than 300\,\textdegree C. The results reveal that HTC  has the potential to produce solid carbonized products with better fuel quality.},

OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effect of  Eucommia ulmoides cortex ethanol extract (EU) on hyperuricaemia and explores the  underlying mechanism in Kunming mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: Sixty mice and sixty rats were divided into normal control,  hyperuricaemia, allopurinol (10\,mg/kg) and three EU groups. The EU groups  received intragastric EU at 80, 160, 320\,mg/kg in mice and 100, 200, 400\,mg/kg in  rats for 7\,days. Serum uric acid (SUA) was measured using a kit. mRNA and  proteins were quantified by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemical assays (IHC),  respectively. RESULTS: The Maximal Tolerable Dose (MTD) of EU administered  intragastrically was 18\,g/kg in mice. The intermediate (160\,mg/kg) and high  (320\,mg/kg) EU treatment significantly reduced (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) SUA levels to  130.16\,{$\mu$}mol/L and 109.29\,{$\mu$}mol/L, respectively, and markedly elevated the mRNA  expression of organic anion transporters 1 (OAT1) and organic anion transporters  3 (OAT3), while significantly deceasing the mRNA levels of glucose transporter 9  (GLUT9) and uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) in the mouse kidney (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). In  hyperuricemic rats, high EU (400\,mg/kg) significantly reduced SUA levels to  253.85\,{$\mu$}mol/L, and increased OAT1 and OAT3 levels, but decreased URAT1 and GLUT9,  compared to the hyperuricaemia group (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This  study demonstrated the potential hyperuricaemia ameliorating effect of EU.  Specific active ingredients in EU should be evaluated. These results are valuable  for the development of antihyperuritic agents from EU.},

  abstract = {Hypertensive nephropathy (HN) is a medical condition in which chronic high blood pressure causes different kidney damage, including vascular, glomerular and  tubulointerstitial lesions. For HN patients, glomerular and tubulointerstitial  lesions occur in different renal structure with distinct mechanisms in the  progression of renal damage. As an extraction of Eucommia ulmoides, Quan-du-zhong  capsule (QDZJN) has the potential to treat HN due to antihypertensive and renal  protective activities. Complicated mechanism of HN underlying various renal  lesions and the "multi-component and multi-target" characteristics of QDZJN make  identifying drug positioning for various renal lesions of HN complex. Here, we  proposed an approach based on drug perturbation of disease network robustness,  that is used to assess QDZJN positioning for various HN lesions. Topological  characteristics of drug-attacked nodes in disease network were used to evaluated  nodes importance to network. To evaluate drug attack on the whole disease network  of various HN lesions, the robustness of disease networks before/after drug  attack were assessed and compared with null models generated from random  networks. We found that potential targets of QDZJN were specifically expressed in  the kidneys and tended to participate in the "inflammatory response," "regulation  of blood pressure," and "response to LPS and hypoxia," and they were also key  factors of HN. Based on network robustness assessment, QDZJN may specifically  target glomeruli account to the stronger influence on glomerular network after  removal of its potential targets. This prediction strategy of drug positioning is  suitable for multi-component drugs based on drug perturbation of disease network  robustness for two renal compartments, glomeruli and tubules. A stronger  influence on the disease network of glomeruli than of tubules indicated that  QDZJN may specifically target glomerular lesion of HN patients and will provide  more evidence for precise clinical application of QDZJN against HN. Drug  positioning approach we proposed also provides a new strategy for predicting  precise clinical use of multi-target drugs.},

We investigated the potential of Eucommia ulmoides  leaf extract (EUL) to control dyslipidemia in NAFLD. EUL supplementation (200  mg/kg) promoted recovery from high fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid dysmetabolism.  This hepatoprotective efficacy was accompanied by suppression of endoplasmic  reticulum (ER) stress, enhancing lysosomal functions, and thereby increasing  autophagic flux. We found a strong indication that inhibition of the mTOR-ER  stress pathway was related to the enhanced autophagic flux. However, the direct  antioxidative effect of EUL on cytoprotection cannot be ruled out as a  significant contributing factor in NAFLD. Our findings will aid in further  elucidating the mechanism of the anti-steatosis activity of EUL and highlight the  therapeutic potential of EUL in the treatment of NAFLD.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. is a medicinal plant native to China, with its bark (Eucommiae Cortex) traditionally being used for medicinal purposes.  Previous research has shown that Eucommia male flowers can exert  anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antibacterial, and other pharmacological effects,  including immune regulation. This study explored the anti-inflammatory effects of  the 70\% ethanol extract of male flowers (EF) of E. ulmoides in lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and LPS-administered mice. METHODS: Cytotoxicity  of EF for RAW 264.7 cells was investigated using Cell Counting Kit-8. The  production of proinflammatory mediators, nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF)-{$\alpha$}, interleukin (IL)-1{$\beta$}, and IL-6 was determined using enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assays. IL-17, IL-23, and IL-10 mRNA levels were determined using  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Activation of the nuclear  factor (NF)-{$\kappa$}B pathway in RAW 264.7 cells was investigated via Western blotting.  In vivo anti-inflammatory effects of EF were studied in an LPS-induced acute  inflammation mouse model by analyzing lung tissue histopathology, serum TNF-{$\alpha$} and  IL-6 levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissue. RESULTS: EF  showed no significant cytotoxicity at concentrations from 10 to 60{$\mkern1mu\mu$}g/mL (cell  viability{$\mkern1mu>\mkern1mu$}80\%) in the CCK-8 cell viability assay. EF inhibited the RAW 264.7  cell proliferation (EF 60{$\mkern1mu\mu$}g/mL, 120{$\mkern1mu\mu$}g/mL, and 250{$\mkern1mu\mu$}g/mL vs. negative control:  87.31{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.39\% vs. 100.00{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.50\%, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.001; 79.01{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.56 vs. 100.00{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.50\%,  P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001; and 64.83{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.50 vs. 100.00{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}2.50\%, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001), suppressed NO (EF  20{$\mkern1mu\mu$}g/mL and 30{$\mkern1mu\mu$}g/mL vs. LPS only, 288.81{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}38.01 vs. 447.68{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}19.07{$\mkern1mu\mu$}mol/L,  P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.004; and 158.80{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}45.14 vs. 447.68{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}19.07{$\mkern1mu\mu$}mol/L, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001), TNF-{$\alpha$}  (LPS+EF vs. LPS only, 210.20{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}13.85 vs. 577.70{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}5.35{$\mkern1mu$}pg/mL, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001), IL-1{$\beta$}  (LPS+EF vs. LPS only, 193.30{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}10.80 vs. 411.03{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}42.28{$\mkern1mu$}pg/mL, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001), and  IL-6 (LPS+EF vs. LPS only, 149.67{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}11.60 vs. 524.80{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}6.24{$\mkern1mu$}pg/mL, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001)  secretion, and downregulated the mRNA expression of IL-17 (LPS+EF vs. LPS only,  0.23{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.02 vs. 0.43{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.12, P{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.001), IL-23 (LPS+EF vs. LPS only, 0.29{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.01  vs. 0.42{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.06, P=0.002), and IL-10 (LPS+EF vs. LPS only, 0.30{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.01 vs.  0.47{$\mkern1mu\pm\mkern1mu$}0.01, P=0.008) in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells.

CONCLUSIONS:  EF could effectively inhibit the expression of inflammatory factors and  overactivation of neutrophils.

  abstract = {One of the main challenges in large-scale applications of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) is the significant amount of template needed in polymer  preparation. A new strategy based on room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) was  suggested to solve this problem by reducing the amount of template in the  polymerization recipe. The MIP was synthesized with a mixture of dimethyl  sulfoxide and RTIL (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate) as porogen, in  which chlorogenic acid (CGA) was used as template, 4-vinylpyridine (4-VP) as  functional monomer, and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) as cross-linker.  The influence of polymerization variables, including CGA concentrations, and the  ratio of 4-VP to EDMA on imprinting effect were investigated comprehensively.  Moreover, the properties involving the column permeability, the number of binding  sites, and the polymer morphology of the CGA-MIP monoliths were studied  thoroughly. The MIP monolith had an excellent column permeability  (1.53\,\texttimes\,10(-13)~m(2)) and allowed an ultra-fast on-line SPE, which dramatically  shortens the separation time ({$<$}\,10~min) and improves the separation efficiency.  At high flow velocity (5.0~mL~min(-1)), 50~{$\mu$}L of the extract from Eucommia  ulmoides leaves can be loaded directly on the CGA-MIP monoliths and CGA with high  purity can be obtained with a recovery of 89.01\,{$\pm$}\,0.05\%. As a conclusion, the  resulting RTIL-induced approach of preparing MIP may be an effective tool in  fabricating MIP in a low-cost way. Graphical abstract ᅟ.},

  abstract = {Neuroinflammation and imbalance of neurotransmitters play pivotal roles in seizures and epileptogenesis. Aucubin (AU) is an iridoid glycoside derived from  Eucommia ulmoides that possesses anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects.  However, the anti-seizure effects of AU have not been reported so far. The  present study was designed to investigate the effects of AU on pilocarpine (PILO)  induced seizures and its role in the regulation of neuroinflammation and  neurotransmission. We found that AU reduced seizure intensity and prolonged the  latency of seizures. AU significantly attenuated the activation of astrocytes and  microglia and reduced the levels of interleukine-1 beta (IL-1{$\beta$}), high mobility  group box 1 (HMGB1), tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}). Furthermore, the contents  of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were increased while the levels of glutamate were  decreased in the hippocampus with AU treatment. The expression of {$\gamma$}-aminobutyric  acid type A receptor subunit {$\alpha$}1 (GABA(A)R{$\alpha$}1) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1)  protein were up-regulated in AU treatment group. However, AU had no significant  effect on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) expression in status  epilepticus (SE). In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence that AU  can exert anti-seizure effects by attenuating gliosis and regulating  neurotransmission. The results suggest that AU may be developed as a drug  candidate for the treatment of epilepsy.},

  abstract = {Eucommia~ulmoides Oliver (Du-Zhong) is an ancient Chinese herbal remedy used for the treatment of various diseases. To date, the effects of its constituent  lignans on influenza viruses remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a  lignan glycoside was isolated and purified from Eucommia~ulmoides Oliver. Its  structures were identified via extensive spectroscopic analysis, and its  antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities, specifically against influenza  viruses, were determined via a cytopathic effect (CPE) assay, plaque-reduction  assays, a progeny virus yield reduction assay, reverse transcription-quantitative  polymerase chain reaction analysis and a Luminex assay. Additionally, western  blot analysis was performed to investigate the underlying mechanisms of its  effects against influenza viruses. The chemical and spectroscopic methods  determined the structure of lignan glycoside to be  (+)-pinoresinol-O-{$\beta$}-D-glucopyranoside. The CPE assay showed that  (+)-pinoresinol-O-{$\beta$}-D-glucopyranoside exerted inhibitory activities with 50\%  inhibition concentration values of 408.81{$\pm$}5.24 and 176.24{$\pm$}4.41~\textmu g/ml against the  influenza~A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Guangzhou/GIRD07/09 (H1N1) strains,  respectively. Its antiviral properties were confirmed by plaque reduction and  progeny virus yield reduction assays. Additional mechanistic analyses indicated  that the anti-H1N1 virus-induced effects of (+)-pinoresinol-O-{$\beta$}-D-glucopyranoside  were likely due to inactivation of the nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B, p38 mitogen-activated  protein kinase and AKT signaling pathways. Furthermore,  (+)-pinoresinol-O-{$\beta$}-D-glucopyranoside exhibited pronounced inhibitory effects on  the expression of influenza H1N1 virus-induced pro-inflammatory mediators,  including tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and monocyte  chemoattractant protein~1.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of Du-Zhong cortex extract (DZCE) on lead acetate-induced bone loss in rats. Forty female  Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: group I (control) was  provided with distilled water. Group II (PbAc) received 500~ppm lead acetate in  drinking water for 60~days. Group III (PbAc+DZCE) received 500~ppm lead acetate  in drinking water, and given intragastric DZCE (100~mg/kg body weight) for  60~days. Group IV (DZCE) was given intragastric DZCE (100~mg/kg body weight) for  60~days. The bone mineral density, serum biochemical markers, bone  histomorphology, and bone marrow adipocyte parameters were analyzed using  dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, biochemistry, histomorphometry, and  histopathology, respectively. The results showed that the lumbar spine and femur  bone mineral density was significantly decreased in PbAc group compared with the  control (P\,{$<$}\,0.05); however, this decrease was inhibited by the intake of  Du-Zhong cortex extract (P\,{$<$}\,0.05, vs. PbAc group; P\,{$>~$}0.05, vs. control and DZCE  group). Serum calcium and serum phosphorus in the PbAc+DZCE group were greater  than that in the PbAc group (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). The PbAc group had higher ALP,  osteocalcin, and RANKL than the control group (P\,{$<$}\,0.01), and they were  significantly lower in the PbAc+DZCE group compared with the PbAc group. There  were no significant differences of ALP, osteocalcin, and RANKL among the  PbAc+DZCE, control, and DZCE groups (P\,{$>$}\,0.05). Serum OPG and OPG/RANKL ration  were significantly higher in the PbAc+DZCE group than that in the PbAc group  (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). The bone histomorphometric analyses showed that bone volume and  trabecular thickness in the femoral trabecular bone were significantly lower in  the PbAc group than that in the control group, but those were restored in the  PbAc+DZCE groups. The bone marrow adipocyte number, percent adipocyte volume per  tissue volume (AV/TV), and mean adipocyte diameter were significantly increased  in the PbAc group compared to the control (P\,{$<$}\,0.01), and those were restored in  the PbAc+DZCE group. The differences of those parameters between PbAc+DZCE, DZCE,  and the control group were not significant. The results above indicate that the  Du-Zhong cortex extract has protective effects on both stimulation of bone  formation and suppression of bone resorption in lead-exposed rats, therefore,  Du-Zhong cortex extract has the potential to prevent or treat osteoporosis  resulting from lead expose.},

There have been a number of machine learning-based methods proposed for this task, which predict a chemical structure of a given spectrum through an intermediate (chemical structure) representation called molecular fingerprints. They usually have two steps: (i) predicting fingerprints from spectra; (ii) searching chemical compounds (in database) corresponding to the predicted fingerprints. Fingerprints are feature vectors, which are usually very large to cover all possible substructures and chemical properties, and therefore heavily redundant, in the sense of having many molecular (sub)structures irrelevant to the task, causing limited predictive performance and slow prediction.                                         Results               We propose ADAPTIVE, which has two parts: learning two mappings (i) from structures to molecular vectors and (ii) from spectra to molecular vectors. The first part learns molecular vectors for metabolites from given data, to be consistent with both spectra and chemical structures of metabolites. In more detail, molecular vectors are generated by a model, being parameterized by a message passing neural network, and parameters are estimated by maximizing the correlation between molecular vectors and the corresponding spectra in terms of Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion. Molecular vectors generated by this model are compact and importantly adaptive (specific) to both given data and task of metabolite identification. The second part uses input output kernel regression (IOKR), the current cutting-edge method of metabolite identification. We empirically confirmed the effectiveness of ADAPTIVE by using a benchmark data, where ADAPTIVE outperformed the original IOKR in both predictive performance and computational efficiency.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of computational tools for metabolism prediction have been developed over the last 20~years to predict the structures of small molecules undergoing biological transformation or environmental degradation. These tools were largely developed to facilitate absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies, although there is now a growing interest in using such tools to facilitate metabolomics and exposomics studies. However, their use and widespread adoption is still hampered by several factors, including their limited scope, breath of coverage, availability, and performance. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we have developed BioTransformer, a freely available software package for accurate, rapid, and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction and compound identification. BioTransformer combines a machine learning approach with a knowledge-based approach to predict small molecule metabolism in human tissues (e.g. liver tissue), the human gut as well as the environment (soil and water microbiota), via its metabolism prediction tool. A comprehensive evaluation of BioTransformer showed that it was able to outperform two state-of-the-art commercially available tools (Meteor Nexus and ADMET Predictor), with precision and recall values up to 7 times better than those obtained for Meteor Nexus or ADMET Predictor on the same sets of pharmaceuticals, pesticides, phytochemicals or endobiotics under similar or identical constraints. Furthermore BioTransformer was able to reproduce 100\% of the transformations and metabolites predicted by the EAWAG pathway prediction system. Using mass spectrometry data obtained from a rat experimental study with epicatechin supplementation, BioTransformer was also able to correctly identify 39 previously reported epicatechin metabolites via its metabolism identification tool, and suggest 28 potential metabolites, 17 of which matched nine monoisotopic masses for which no evidence of a previous report could be found. CONCLUSION: BioTransformer can be used as an open access command-line tool, or a software library. It is freely available at https://bitbucket.org/djoumbou/biotransformerjar/ . Moreover, it is also freely available as an open access RESTful application at www.biotransformer.ca , which allows users to manually or programmatically submit queries, and retrieve metabolism predictions or compound identification data.},

  abstract = {Metabolite identification for untargeted metabolomics is often hampered by the lack of experimentally collected reference spectra from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). To circumvent this problem, Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID) was developed to accurately predict electrospray ionization-MS/MS (ESI-MS/MS) spectra from chemical structures and to aid in compound identification via MS/MS spectral matching. While earlier versions of CFM-ID performed very well, CFM-ID's performance for predicting the MS/MS spectra of certain classes of compounds, including many lipids, was quite poor. Furthermore, CFM-ID's compound identification capabilities were limited because it did not use experimentally available MS/MS spectra nor did it exploit metadata in its spectral matching algorithm. Here, we describe significant improvements to CFM-ID's performance and speed. These include (1) the implementation of a rule-based fragmentation approach for lipid MS/MS spectral prediction, which greatly improves the speed and accuracy of CFM-ID; (2) the inclusion of experimental MS/MS spectra and other metadata to enhance CFM-ID's compound identification abilities; (3) the development of new scoring functions that improves CFM-ID's accuracy by 21.1\%; and (4) the implementation of a chemical classification algorithm that correctly classifies unknown chemicals (based on their MS/MS spectra) in {$>$}80\% of the cases. This improved version called CFM-ID 3.0 is freely available as a web server. Its source code is also accessible online.},

However, no single analytical method allows monitoring all metabolites in a sample, resulting in incomplete metabolic fingerprints. This incompleteness constitutes a stumbling block to interpretation, raising the need for methods that can enrich those fingerprints. We propose MetaboRank, a new solution inspired by social network recommendation systems for the identification of metabolites potentially related to a metabolic fingerprint. Results: MetaboRank method had been used to enrich metabolomics data obtained on cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients suffering from hepatic encephalopathy (HE). MetaboRank successfully recommended metabolites not present in the original fingerprint. The quality of recommendations was evaluated by using literature automatic search, in order to check that recommended metabolites could be related to the disease. Complementary mass spectrometry experiments and raw data analysis were performed to confirm these suggestions. In particular, MetaboRank recommended the overlooked {$\alpha$}-ketoglutaramate as a metabolite which should be added to the metabolic fingerprint of HE, thus suggesting that metabolic fingerprints enhancement can provide new insight on complex diseases. Availability and implementation: Method is implemented in the MetExplore server and is available at www.metexplore.fr.

Here, we develop a metabolic reaction network (MRN)-based recursive algorithm (MetDNA) that expands metabolite annotations without the need for a comprehensive standard spectral library. MetDNA is based on the rationale that seed metabolites and their reaction-paired neighbors tend to share structural similarities resulting in similar MS2 spectra. MetDNA characterizes initial seed metabolites using a small library of MS2 spectra, and utilizes their experimental MS2 spectra as surrogate spectra to annotate their reaction-paired neighbor metabolites, which subsequently serve as the basis for recursive analysis. Using different LC-MS platforms, data acquisition methods, and biological samples, we showcase the utility and versatility of MetDNA and demonstrate that about 2000 metabolites can cumulatively be annotated from one experiment. Our results demonstrate that MetDNA substantially expands metabolite annotation, enabling quantitative assessment of metabolic pathways and facilitating integrative multi-omics analysis.},

  abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large and diverse class of chemicals of great interest due to their wide commercial applicability, as well  as increasing public concern regarding their adverse impacts. A common  terminology for PFASs was recommended in 2011, including broad categorization and  detailed naming for many PFASs with rather simple molecular structures. Recent  advancements in chemical analysis have enabled identification of a wide variety  of PFASs that are not covered by this common terminology. The resulting  inconsistency in categorizing and naming of PFASs is preventing efficient  assimilation of reported information. This article explores how a combination of  expert knowledge and cheminformatics approaches could help address this challenge  in a systematic manner. First, the "splitPFAS" approach was developed to  systematically subdivide PFASs (for eventual categorization) following a  C(n)F(2n+1)-X-R pattern into their various parts, with a particular focus on 4  PFAS categories where X is CO, SO(2), CH(2) and CH(2)CH(2). Then, the open,  ontology-based "ClassyFire" approach was tested for potential applicability to  categorizing and naming PFASs using five scenarios of original and simplified  structures based on the "splitPFAS" output. This workflow was applied to a set of  770 PFASs from the latest OECD PFAS list. While splitPFAS categorized PFASs as  intended, the ClassyFire results were mixed. These results reveal that open  cheminformatics approaches have the potential to assist in categorizing PFASs in  a consistent manner, while much development is needed for future systematic  naming of PFASs. The "splitPFAS" tool and related code are publicly available,  and include options to extend this proof-of-concept to encompass further PFASs in  the future.},

Metabolomics detects vastly more metabolic  signals that may be used to precisely define the health status of individuals.  However, many compounds remain unidentified, hampering biochemical conclusions.  Here, we annotate all metabolites detected by two untargeted metabolomic assays,  hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry  and charged surface hybrid (CSH)-Q Exactive HF mass spectrometry. Over 9,000  unique metabolite signals were detected, of which 42\% triggered MS/MS  fragmentations in data-dependent mode. On the highest Metabolomics Standards  Initiative (MSI) confidence level 1, we identified 175 compounds using authentic  standards with precursor mass, retention time, and MS/MS matching. An additional  578 compounds were annotated by precursor accurate mass and MS/MS matching alone,  MSI level 2, including a novel library specifically geared at acylcarnitines  (CarniBlast). The rest of the metabolome is usually left unannotated. To fill  this gap, we used the in silico fragmentation tool CSI:FingerID and the new NIST  hybrid search to annotate all further compounds (MSI level 3). Testing the  top-ranked metabolites in CSI:Finger ID annotations yielded 40\% accuracy when  applied to the MSI level 1 identified compounds. We classified all MSI level 3  annotations by the NIST hybrid search using the ClassyFire ontology into 21  superclasses that were further distinguished into 184 chemical classes.  ClassyFire annotations showed that the previously unannotated urine metabolome  consists of 28\% derivatives of organic acids, 16\% heterocyclics, and 16\% lipids  as major classes.},

They provide variable importance measures to rank predictors according to their predictive power. If building a prediction model is the main goal of a study, often a minimal set of variables with good prediction performance is selected. However, if the objective is the identification of involved variables to find active networks and pathways, approaches that aim to select all relevant variables should be preferred. We evaluated several variable selection procedures based on simulated data as well as publicly available experimental methylation and gene expression data. Our comparison included the Boruta algorithm, the Vita method, recurrent relative variable importance, a permutation approach and its parametric variant (Altmann) as well as recursive feature elimination (RFE). {$\quad$}In our simulation studies, Boruta was the most powerful approach, followed closely by the Vita method. Both approaches demonstrated similar stability in variable selection, while Vita was the most robust approach under a pure null model without any predictor variables related to the outcome. In the analysis of the different experimental data sets, Vita demonstrated slightly better stability in variable selection and was less computationally intensive than Boruta. In conclusion, we recommend the Boruta and Vita approaches for the analysis of high-dimensional data sets. Vita is considerably faster than Boruta and thus more suitable for large data sets, but only Boruta can also be applied in low-dimensional settings.},

  abstract = {Excess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased de novo lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid {$\beta$}-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs ex vivo in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.

Accurate classification of RCC and comprehensive understanding of their metabolic dysregulation are of critical importance. Here we investigate the use of metabolomic analyses to classify the main RCC subtypes and to describe the metabolic variation for each subtype. To this end, we performed metabolomic profiling of 65 RCC frozen samples (40 clear cell, 14 papillary and 11 chromophobe) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. OPLS-DA multivariate analysis based on metabolomic data showed clear discrimination of all three main subtypes of RCC (R               2               \,=\,75.0\%, Q               2               \,=\,59.7\%). The prognostic performance was evaluated using an independent cohort and showed an AUROC of 0.924, 0.991 and 1 for clear cell, papillary and chromophobe RCC, respectively. Further pathway analysis using the 21 top metabolites showed significant differences in amino acid and fatty acid metabolism between three RCC subtypes. In conclusion, this study shows that metabolomic profiling could serve as a tool that is complementary to histology for RCC subtype classification. An overview of metabolic dysregulation in RCC subtypes was established giving new insights into the understanding of their clinical behaviour and for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major degenerative disease that affects the elderly. The global prevalence of OA is increasing annually. However, current  treatments are unable to halt the progress of OA. At present, pharmacological  treatments such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and  cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors control the pain; however, there may be side  effects to these medications. We hypothesized that Cortex Eucommiae (CE; Eucommia  ulmoides Oliver) extract, which is used as a dietary supplement, may slow down or  prevent OA. METHODS: This is a protocol for a 12-week, multicenter, randomized,  double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy  and safety of CE extract in subjects with mild OA. One-hundred subjects with mild  OA will be recruited and randomly divided in a 1:1 ratio into 2 groups. One group  will receive CE extract for 12 weeks and the other group will receive placebo for  12 weeks. Outcomes will be evaluated by using the visual analog scale (VAS),  Korean-Western Ontario and McMaster Universities index (K-WOMAC), Korean-Short  Form health survey-36 score (KSF-36), and laboratory test results. DISCUSSION:  This clinical trial is expected to provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of  CE extract as a treatment for mild OA.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The potential adverse effects of conventional oral pharmacotherapy of osteoarthritis (OA) restrict their long-term use. Topical application of a  Chinese herbal paste for relieving OA knee pain can be effective and safe.  However, evidence-based scientific research is insufficient to support its  application worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo  efficacy of a topical Chinese herbal paste on relieving OA knee pain and its  underlying mechanism. METHODS: An OA rat model was developed by anterior cruciate  ligament transection (ACLT) followed by treadmill running. A herbal paste  including Dipsaci Radix, Achyranthis Bidentatae Radix, Eucommiae Cortex and  Psoraleae Fructus, named as DAEP, was applied topically on the knee joint of the  rats (DAEP). The rats without DAEP treatment served as Control. Rats with surgery  but without ACLT, treadmill running and DAEP treatment acted as Sham. The  morphologic change of the knee joint was observed radiographically. Nociception  from the knee of the rats was assessed using Incapacitent test and CatWalk gait  system. The therapeutic mechanism was investigated by analyzing the gene and  protein expression of inflammatory markers via qPCR and Western blot,  respectively. RESULTS: Radiographic images showed less destruction at the  posterior tibial plateau of the DAEP group compared with the Control after  2~weeks of treatment. The static weight ratio and the gait parameters of the  Control were reduced significantly via Incapacitance test and CatWalk gait  analysis, respectively. DAEP treatment increased the Print Area and Maximum  Intensity significantly compared with the Control. DAEP significantly suppressed  the upregulation of gene expression of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor  (TNF)-{$\alpha$}, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). CONCLUSIONS: DAEP exhibited  its effect via the nuclear factor (NF)-{$\kappa$}B pathway by suppressing the  phosphorylation of I{$\kappa$}B kinase {$\alpha\beta$} (p-IKK{$\alpha\beta$}) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein  expression. This study provides scientific evidence to support the clinical  application of the Chinese herbal paste on reliving OA pain.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by increasing osseous fragility and fracture due to the reduced bone mass and microstructural degradation. Primary  pharmacological strategies for the treatment of osteoporosis, hormone replacement  treatment (HRT), and alendronate therapies may produce adverse side-effects and  may not be recommended for long-term usage. Some classic and bone-specific  natural Chinese medicine are very popularly used to treat osteoporosis and bone  fracture effectively in clinical with their potential value in bone growth and  development, but with few adverse side-effects. Current evidence suggests that  the treatments appear to improve bone metabolism and attenuate the osteoporotic  imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption at a cellular level by  promoting osteoblast activity and inhibiting the effects of osteoclasts. The  valuable therapies might, therefore, provide an effective and safer alternative  to primary pharmacological strategies. Therefore, the purpose of this article is  to comprehensively review these classic and bone-specific drugs in natural  Chinese medicines for the treatment of osteoporosis that had been deeply and  definitely studied and reported with both bone formation and antiresorption  effects, including Gynochthodes officinalis (F.C.How) Razafim. \& B.Bremer (syn.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to find the possible key targets of Yougui pill and Buzhong Yiqi decoction for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  The composition of Yougui pill combined with Buzhong Yiqi decoction was obtained,  and its effective components of medicine were screened using ADME; the component  target proteins were predicted and screened based on the TCMSP and BATMAN  databases. Target proteins were cross-validated using the CTD database. We  performed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)  pathway analyses for target proteins using the Cytoscape plugin  ClueGO\,+\,CluePedia and the R package clusterProfiler, respectively. Subsequently,  protein-protein interaction (PPI) analyses were conducted using the STRING  database. Finally, a pharmacological network was constructed. RESULTS: The  pharmacological network contained 89 nodes and 176 relation pairs. Among these  nodes, there were 12 for herbal medicines (orange peel, licorice, Eucommia,  Aconite, Astragalus, Chinese wolfberry, yam, dodder seed, ginseng, Cornus  officinalis, Rehmannia, and Angelica), 9 for chemical components  (18-beta-glycyrrhetinic acid, carvacrol, glycyrrhetinic acid, higenamine,  nobilin, quercetin, stigmasterol, synephrine, and thymol), 62 for target proteins  (e.g., NR3C1, ESR1, PTGS2, CAT, TNF, INS, and TP53), and 6 for pathways (MAPK  signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, dopaminergic synapse, thyroid hormone  signaling pathway, cAMP signaling pathway, and neuroactive ligand-receptor  interaction). CONCLUSION: NR3C1, ESR1, PTGS2, CAT, TNF, INS, and TP53 may be  important targets for the key active elements in the decoction combining Yougui  pill and Buzhong Yiqi. Furthermore, these target proteins are relevant to the  treatment of sexual dysfunction, probably via pathways associated with cancer and  signal transduction.},

  abstract = {Phomopsis sp. XP-8, an endophytic fungus from the bark of Tu-Chung (Eucommia ulmoides Oliv) showed capability to biosynthesize pinoresinol (Pin) and  pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG) from glucose (glu) and phenylalanine (Phe). To  verify the mass flow in the biosynthesis pathway, [(13)C(6)]-labeled glu and  [(13)C(6)]-labeled Phe were separately fed to the strain as sole substrates and  [(13)C(6)]-labeled products were detected by ultra-high-performance liquid  chromatography-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry. As results,  [(13)C(6)]-labeled Phe was incorporated into [(13)C(6)]-cinnamylic acid (Ca) and  p-coumaric acid (p-Co), and [(13)C(12)]-labeled Pin, which revealed that the Pin  benzene ring came from Phe via the phenylpropane pathway. [(13)C(6)]-Labeled Ca  and p-Co, [(13)C(12)]-labeled Pin, [(13)C(18)]-labeled pinoresinol monoglucoside  (PMG), and [(13)C(18)]-labeled PDG products were found when [(13)C(6)]-labeled  glu was used, demonstrating that the benzene ring and glucoside of PDG originated  from glu. It was also determined that PMG was not the direct precursor of PDG in  the biosynthetic pathway. The study identified the occurrence of phenylalanine-  lignan biosynthesis pathway in fungi at the level of mass flow.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To prepare a soft lining material with high elastic on the basis of excellent characteristics of Eucommia ulmoides gum, and explore its basic  physical performance and cytotoxity. METHODS: Basic formula was used based on the  existing formula of elastic Eucommia ulmoides gum and medical rubber, then  hardness, tensile strength and elongation at break were investigated to determine  the final formula of the material, named Eucommia ulmoides gum composite soft  denture liner. L929 mouse fibroblasts cultured in vitro were used to detect the  toxic effects of 50\% of leaching solution released from three kinds of denture  soft lining materials by MTT assay. Statistical analysis was performed using  SPSS16.0 software package. RESULTS: The kinds and blending proportion of rubber  matrix had significant impact on mechanical properties of Eucommia ulmoides gum  composite soft denture liner, the addition of Eucommia ulmoides gum significantly  increased the hardness, tensile strength and elongation at break of the butadiene  rubber. MTT assay showed Eucommia ulmoides gum composite soft denture liner did  not have cytotoxicity on L929 mouse fibroblasts. The toxicity levels of 5 groups  of Eucommia ulmoides gum composite soft denture liner in the 2nd, 4th, 7th day  were maintained in the first stage, only 70:30 group reached the second stage on  the 7th day. The cell relative appreciation rate of Silagum and 5 groups of  Eucommia ulmoides gum composite soft denture liner in 2nd, 4th, 7th day were  significantly higher than that in the self-curing acrylic soft lining material  (P{$<$}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Eucommia ulmoides gum and butadiene rubber blend ratio of  70:30, adding appropriate amount of zinc oxide, magnesium, stearic acid, sublimed  sulfur, CZ, antioxidants, can get optimum mechanical properties. Eucommia  ulmoides gum composite soft denture liner has no effect on L929 fibroblasts  proliferation, indicating good biocompatibility.},

The bone density and  trabecular bone number of osteoporosis model rats can be significantly improved  after treatment with rutin. Further study using whole gene expression profiling  revealed that FNDC1, a fibronectin type III domain-containing protein, may be a  novel bone metabolism-related factor that is decreased in rutin-treated rats. The  mechanism underlying the effects of rutin treatment on osteoporosis is important  to explore. Micro-CT, western blotting, quantitative PCR, transmission electron  microscopy, and Alizarin Red mineralization staining assays were performed to  evaluate bone density, FNDC1 expression and autophagy to determine whether FNDC1  might play a significant role in rutin-inhibited trabecular bone loss in rats.  FNDC1 expression was high in the osteoporosis group, whereas rutin treatment  facilitated FNDC1 downregulation. In addition, rutin promoted bone marrow  mesenchymal stem cell autophagy by inhibiting phosphorylated Akt in osteoporosis.  In summary, our study shows that rutin could regulate FNCD1 level and autophagy  through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway to provide a novel therapeutic strategy  for osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Chondrocyte apoptosis has also been strongly correlated with the severity of cartilage damage and matrix depletion in an osteoarthritis (OA)  joint. Therefore, pharmacological inhibitors of apoptosis may provide a novel  treatment option for patients with OA. Aucubin, a natural compound isolated from  Eucommia ulmoides, has been proved to possess antioxidative and anti-apoptotic  properties. However, anti-osteoarthritis effect of aucubin in animal model and  anti-apoptotic response of aucubin in OA chondrocytes remain unclear. This study  aimed to determine whether aucubin could slow progression of OA in a mouse model  and inhibit the IL-1{$\beta$}-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. METHODS: OA severity and  articular cartilage degradation were evaluated by Safranin-O staining,  Hematoxylin-eosin (H\&E) staining, and Osteoarthritis Research Society  International (OARSI) standards. Chondrocyte viability was observed by Cell  Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and live/dead cells assay; the apoptotic rate of  chondrocytes was evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM) with Annexin V-FITC/PI kit.  Mediators of apoptosis were tested by Western blot of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-9,  and Bcl-2 expression. The intracellular levels of Reactive oxygen species (ROS)  were assessed by the probe of 2,7-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA).  RESULTS: The articular cartilage in the limb with destabilization of the medial  meniscus (DMM) exhibited early OA-like manifestations characterized by  proteoglycan loss, cartilage fibrillation, and erosion, with lower OARSI score.  Oral administration of aucubin remarkably attenuated the loss of proteoglycan and  the articular cartilage erosion and decreased the OARSI scores underwent DMM  surgery. Aucubin treatment significantly reverses IL-1{$\beta$}-induced cytotoxicity and  attenuated the IL-1{$\beta$}-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. In addition, aucubin can  significantly inhibit mediators of apoptosis in rat primary chondrocytes.  Furthermore, aucubin remarkably attenuated the IL-1{$\beta$}-induced intracellular ROS  production. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that aucubin has a protective effect  on articular cartilage and slowing progression of OA in a mouse model. This  protective effect may result from inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis and excessive  ROS production.},

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and synchronous  fluorescence spectroscopic (SyFS) spectra of Eucommia ulmoides seed oil (EUSO)  are lacking. The relevant functional and fluorescent groups were determined by  FTIR and SyFS techniques for discriminating adulteration of EUSO, respectively.  FTIR and SyFS spectra of EUSO and six common-used vegetable oils were recorded  from 4000-400 cm(-1) and 250-700 nm at wavelength interval of 60 nm,  respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis  (LDA), cluster analysis (CA) and partial least square (PLS) regression was used  for qualitative and quantitative calibration of EUSO adulteration. The FTIR  spectral regions of 1429-1377 cm(-1) and 1128-1110 cm(-1) based on PCA, LDA, and  CA, and the PCA of SyFS spectral regions of 600-700 nm and 300-500 nm were  evaluated for qualitative differentiation of EUSO adulteration. The recognition  rate of PCA validation was found to be 100\% by FTIR regions. PLS calibration was  optimal by the spectral normalization vector treatment in the two FTIR spectral  regions and SyFS spectra were combined with characteristic absorption peak area,  which can achieve quantitative detection of EUSO adulteration. The two techniques  are useful for EUSO adulteration detection at levels down to 1\% and 0.48\% (w/w),  respectively. The results indicated that spectral information obtained by FTIR  and SyFS of EUSO can be used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of EUSO  adulteration with the advantages of high sensitivity, simplicity, and rapidness.},

NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway plays a very important role in  the defense mechanism. This study was designed to investigate the regulation of  EUF on the Nrf2 pathway and inhibition of Nrf2 on oxidative stress in the  intestine of piglets. An in vivo study was conducted in weaned piglets treated  with basal diet, basal diet+diquat, and 100\,mg/kg EUF diet+diquat for 14\,d to  determine Nrf2 and Keap1 protein expressions, as well as downstream antioxidant  gene mRNA expression. An in vitro study was performed in a porcine jejunal  epithelial cell line to investigate the effect of inhibiting Nrf2 on cell growth  and intracellular oxidative stress parameters. The results showed that the  supplementation of EUF decreased the oxidized glutathione (GSSG) concentration  and the ratio of GSSG to glutathione (GSH) but increased the protein expressions  of nuclear Nrf2 and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) as well as mRNA  expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1),  and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) in the small intestinal  mucosa of diquat-challenged piglets. When Nrf2 was inhibited by using ML385, cell  viability, cellular antioxidant activities, expressions of nuclear Nrf2 and Keap1  protein, and downstream antioxidant enzyme (HO-1, NQO-1, and GCLC) mRNA were  decreased in paraquat-treated enterocytes. These results showed that the Nrf2  signaling pathway played an important role in EUF-regulating oxidative stress in  the intestine of piglets.},

The crypt  depth in the antibiotics group was of similar value to the EL extract group, and  was lower than the fermented EL and EL powder groups (P {$<$} 0.05). Compared to the  control and antibiotics groups, the jejunul claudin-3 mRNA expression and the  concentrations of total VFA, Chao 1, and ACE were significantly augmented in the  EL extract group of piglets (P {$<$} 0.05). The EL extract groups also showed  elevated Shannon (P {$<$} 0.05) and Simpson (P = 0.07) values relative to the control  and antibiotics groups. At the phylum level, the EL extract group exhibited a  reduced abundance of Bacteroidetes and an enhanced abundance of Firmicutes. At  the genus level, the abundance of Prevotella was augmented in the EL extract  group. Moreover, compared with the antibiotic group, the acetate concentration  was enhanced in the EL extract and fermented EL groups. Overall, dietary  supplementation with the EL extract, but not the fermented EL or EL powder,  improved growth performance, jejunul morphology and function, as well as changed  colonic microbial composition and diversity, which might be an alternative to  confer protection against weanling stress in weanling piglets.},

We examined the  mechanism by which the combined extracts of Rhus verniciflua and Eucommia  ulmoides extracts (ILF-RE) regulate hepatic dyslipidemia in an established NAFLD  model, high-fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid dysmetabolism in rats. ILF-RE attenuated  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by 1.5\% (p~{$<~$}0.05), aspartate aminotransferase  (AST) by 1.5\% (p~{$<~$}0.05), triglycerides by 1.5\% (p~{$<~$}0.05), cholesterol by 2.0\%  (p~{$<~$}0.05), and lipid peroxidation by 1.5\% (p~{$<~$}0.05) in the NAFLD model. ILF-RE,  recently shown to have anti-oxidant properties, also inhibited hepatic ROS  accumulation by 1.68\% (p~{$<~$}0.05) and regulated ER-redox imbalance, a key  phenomenon of ER stress. Due to nutrient overload stress-associated protein  folding, ER stress and downstream SREBP-lipogenic transcription signaling were  highly activated, and the mTORC1-AMPK axis was also disturbed, leading to hepatic  steatosis. ILF-RE results in recovery from hepatic conditions induced by  nutrient-based protein folding stress signaling and the ER stress-SREBP and  AMPK-mTORC1-SREBP1 axes. Based on these results, ILF-RE is suggested to be a  potential therapeutic strategy for hepatic steatosis and may represent a  promising novel agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.},

Except for the significant  increase of tryptophan in serum of OVX rats, the other four metabolites were  significantly decreased. Moreover, the five biomarkers of the medicine group had  a trend of returning to rats in control group. The significantly altered  metabolite levels indicated that Eucommiae Cortex may relieve the symptoms of  osteoporosis by regulating amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress.},

  abstract = {This study aimed to explore the optimal indications and mechanism of Uncariae Ramulus cum Uncis(UR)-Eucommiae Cortex(EC) in lowering blood pressure based on  network pharmacology and molecular docking. Chemical constituents were collected  and screened by TCMSP database. Swiss Target Prediction platform was used to  predict the related targets of the drug. OMIM, TCMIP and GeneCards databases were  used to collect hypertension-related genes, and the intersections were taken to  obtain potential targets for anti-hypertensive treatment of UR-EC. FunRich  software was used to enrich the clinical phenotype and expression site of  potential target of lowering blood pressure to analyze and predict the optimal  indications of UR-EC. STRING database was used for KEGG pathway enrichment  analysis, and Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to construct the network of  \&quot;composition-target-pathway\&quot;. The key targets and their corresponding  components in the network were analyzed and obtained, and then molecular docking  was applied for preliminary verification. Twenty potential active components of  UR and 24 potential active components of EC were respectively collected, and 92  anti-hypertensive potential targets of UR-EC were obtained. According to FunRich  enrichment results, the optimal indication of UR-EC was pregnancy hypertension,  which involved calcium signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, neuroactive  ligand receptor interaction, renin vascular tightening, VEGF signaling pathway,  etc. In addition, AKT1, NOS2, ADRB2, F2, NOS3, SCN5 A, HTR2 A and JAK2 were  considered as the key targets in the network. The molecular docking results  showed that the screened potential active components had high binding activity  with the key targets. This study preliminarily revealed that UR-EC may have  therapeutic effects on pregnancy hypertension in terms of sedation,  anti-hypertension, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, improvement of vascular  endothelial function and so on.},

  abstract = {We report the acquisition of a high-quality haploid chromosome-scale genome assembly for the first time in a tree species, Eucommia ulmoides, which is known  for its rubber biosynthesis and medicinal applications. The assembly was obtained  by applying PacBio and Hi-C technologies to a haploid that we specifically  generated. Compared to the initial genome release, this one has significantly  improved assembly quality. The scaffold N50 (53.15\,MB) increased 28-fold, and the  repetitive sequence content (520\,Mb) increased by 158.24\,Mb, whereas the number  of gaps decreased from 104,772 to 128. A total of 92.87\% of the 26,001 predicted  protein-coding genes identified with multiple strategies were anchored to the 17  chromosomes. A new whole-genome duplication event was superimposed on the earlier  {$\gamma$} paleohexaploidization event, and the expansion of long terminal repeats  contributed greatly to the evolution of the genome. The more primitive rubber  biosynthesis of this species, as opposed to that in Hevea brasiliensis, relies on  the methylerythritol-phosphate pathway rather than the mevalonate pathway to  synthesize isoprenyl diphosphate, as the MEP pathway operates predominantly in  trans-polyisoprene-containing leaves and central peels. Chlorogenic acid  biosynthesis pathway enzymes were preferentially expressed in leaves rather than  in bark. This assembly with higher sequence contiguity can foster not only  studies on genome structure and evolution, gene mapping, epigenetic analysis and  functional genomics but also efforts to improve E. ulmoides for industrial and  medical uses through genetic engineering.},

The study is aimed at investigating the therapeutic effect of  Zhuang-Gu-Fang in ovariectomized rats. Fifty six-month-old Wistar rats were  randomly selected and divided into 5 groups (n\,=\,10), namely, model group,  positive group, low-dose Chinese medicine group, medium-dose group, and high-dose  group. Another 10 sham operation Wistar rats were taken as a negative control  group. After 3 months of intervention, the bone mineral density (BMD),  procollagen type I N-peptide (PINP), beta C-terminal cross-linked telopeptides of  type I collagen carboxyl-terminal peptide ({$\beta$}-CTX), Leptin, Ghrelin, and Peptide  YY (PYY) of each group were measured. Besides, the ultrastructure of bone  structure and osteoblasts was also observed by transmission electron microscopy.  Western blot method was used to detect the expression levels of Leptin and  Ghrelin in bone tissue, and RT-PCR detected the mRNA expression levels of Leptin  and Ghrelin. BMD test indicated that Zhuang-Gu-Fang could effectively prevent the  loss of tibia bone in ovariectomized rats. Histomorphology analysis showed that  Zhuang-Gu-Fang could preserve trabecular bone structure integrity and improve  osteoblast ultrastructure. Notably, the study found out that Zhuang-Gu-Fang  worked through balancing the bone metabolism via increasing bone  formation/resorption ratio. Additionally, Zhuang-Gu-Fang highlighted the recovery  effects in multiple levels of osteogenesis- and osteanagenesis-related factors  Leptin, Ghrelin, and PYY. Conclusively, the study proved the therapeutic  potential of the Zhuang-Gu-Fang for postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) and  further revealed that its therapeutic effect was related to the balance of bone  metabolism and the recovery effects of bone-related factors Leptin, Ghrelin, and  PYY.},

  abstract = {The combination of Eucommia ulmoides and Tribulus terrestris (ET) has been widely utilized in clinical practice for thousands of years, but the mechanism  underlying its efficacy has not been elucidated to date. This study attempted to  investigate the role played by the intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolism in  the response of elderly spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) to ET administration  as a treatment for hypertension. Fourteen male spontaneously hypertensive rats  (SHRs, 18 months old) were randomly divided into an ET group and an SHR group,  and 7 Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats of the same age were employed as the control group.  The ET group was intragastrically administered 1.0\,g/kg/d ET for 42 days, and  SHRs and WKY rats were administered an equal amount of normal saline  intragastrically. The intestinal microbiota and fecal metabolism were analyzed by  16S rRNA sequencing and the GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry)/MS  assay. ET treatment decreased blood pressure steadily, improved the colonic  tissue morphology, and changed the structure and composition of the imbalanced  microbiota in SHRs. Specifically, ET treatment increased the abundance of  Eubacterium, which might be one of the target microbes for ET, and had a negative  correlation with the levels of {$\alpha$}-tocopherol, chenodeoxycholic acid, and  deoxycholic acid according to the Spearman correlation analysis. The change in  the intestinal microbiota affected the fecal metabolic pattern of SHRs. Eight  potential biomarkers were determined to be primarily enriched in ABC  transporters, phenylalanine metabolism, central carbon metabolism in cancer,  purine metabolism, and protein digestion and absorption. The correlation analysis  demonstrated that the abundance of Eubacterium and the decreased levels of  {$\alpha$}-tocopherol, chenodeoxycholic acid, and deoxycholic acid in the ET group were  highly correlated. Our results suggest that ET has a good antihypertensive  effect, which may be driven by the intestinal microbiota and their beneficial  metabolites. The results of this study may help to elucidate the antihypertensive  mechanism of ET.},

When  this delivery system carries both antigen and immunomodulator, it can effectively  regulate the DC function as well as the initial T cell response. To maximize the  desired therapeutic effects of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. polysaccharides (EUPS),  and induce an efficient humoral and cellular immune response against an antigen,  we encapsulated the OVA and EUPS in long-circling nanoliposomes and conjugated it  with anti-DEC-205 receptor antibody to obtain a DEC-205-targeted nanoliposomes  (anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM). The physicochemical properties and  immune-modulating effects were investigated in~vitro and in~vivo by a series of  the experiment to evaluate the targeting efficiency of  anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM. In vitro, anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM (160\,{$\mu$}g mL(-1))  could enhance DCs proliferation and increase their phagocytic efficiency. In vivo  anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM remarkably promoted the OVA-specific IgG and IgG  isotypes levels, enhanced the splenocyte proliferation, and induced the NK cell  and CTL cytotoxicity. Besides, the anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM enhanced the  maturation of DCs. These findings suggest that the DEC-205 receptor  antibody-conjugated EUPS nanoliposome can act as an efficient antigen delivery  system to enhance the cellular and humoral immune response by promoting DC  maturation. This indicates that the anti-DEC-205-EUPS-OVA-LPSM has significant  potential as an immune-enhancing agent and antigen delivery system.},

The maximum  tolerated dose of EUE was not less than 168~g/kg, which is 1260 times that of  clinical doses in human adults. Long-term (13 weeks) administration led to  dose-dependent increase in nephrotoxicity-related indices, and pathological  changes in renal tissues. These changes were alleviated 5 weeks after ceasing the  low dosage of 11.2~g/kg but persisted at the high dosage of 56~g/kg.  Conclusively, EUE is non-genotoxic, and do not result in acute toxicity.

We investigated the effect of ELE on the development of atherosclerosis and changes  in peritoneal macrophage function in apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE(-/-) ) mice.  At 8 weeks of age, ApoE(-/-) mice were randomly divided into three groups that  were fed a high-fat diet blended with 0\% (control), 5\% or 10\% ELE for a period of  7 weeks. The 10\% ELE dose caused an approximately 36\% reduction in  atherosclerotic lesions, as estimated by oil red O staining. Real-time PCR  analysis showed that the 1-week treatment with ELE reduced mRNA levels of  Tnf-alpha, Il-1, and Mif in peritoneal macrophages isolated from the ApoE(-/-)  mice. Furthermore, a 1-week treatment with the 10\% ELE diet significantly reduced  migration and adhesion functions in peritoneal macrophages. These results suggest  that a 10\% ELE diet reduces atherosclerotic lesions and modulates macrophage  function by reducing cytokine expression. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Eucommia leaf  extract (ELE) is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that reduces  atherosclerotic lesions and suppresses inflammatory cytokines expression.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Du Zhong (DZ), or Eucommiae Cortex, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has been used to treat osteoporosis. Although it has been reported that  DZ can improve bone mass in ovariectomized rats, its pharmacological mechanisms  in treating osteoporotic fractures (OPF) remain unclear. METHODS: In this study,  we used a network pharmacological manner to explore its potential complicated  mechanism in treating OPF. We obtained DZ compounds from TCMSP and BATMAN-TCM  databases and collected potential targets of these compounds through target  fishing based on TCMSP and BATMAN-TCM databases. Next, we collected the OPF  targets by using CTD, GeneCards, OMIM, HPO, and GenCLiP 3 databases. And then the  overlapping genes between DZ potential targets and OPF targets were used to build  up the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and to analyze their  interactions and find out the big hub genes in this network. Subsequently,  clusterProfiler package in R language was utilized to conduct the enrichment of  Gene Ontology biological process and KEGG pathways. RESULTS: There were totally  93 active compounds and 916 related targets in DZ. After the enrichment analysis,  we collected top 25 cellular biological processes and top 25 pathways based on  the adjusted P value and found that the DZ anti-OPF effect was mainly associated  with the regulation of ROS and inflammatory response. Furthermore, 64 hub genes  in PPI network, such as MAPK1 (degree\,=\,41), SRC (degree\,=\,39), PIK3R1  (degree\,=\,36), VEGFA (degree\,=\,31), TP53 (degree\,=\,29), EGFR (degree\,=\,29), JUN  (degree\,=\,29), AGT (degree\,=\,29), MAPK1, SRC, PIK3R1, VEGFA, and TP53, were  considered as potential therapeutic targets, implying the underlying mechanisms  of DZ acting on OPF. CONCLUSION: We investigated the possible therapeutic  mechanisms of DZ from a systemic perspective. These key targets and pathways  provided promising directions for the future research to reveal the exact  regulating mechanisms of DZ in treating OPF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (EUO) was a traditional Chinese herb, its leaves were abundant in China, and polyphenol compounds were considered to be an  important active ingredient in Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves (EUOL). However,  previous research mainly focused on compound identification and extraction  process, there were few reported on the efficient enrichment process and  biological activity evaluation of polyphenols in EUOL. METHODS: The adsorption  and desorption characteristics of twelve different resins (HPD-100, HPD-300,  HPD-600, D-3250, X-5, D-140, NKA-9, NKA-II, D-101, AB-8, S-8 and Polyamide) were  investigated to develop an efficient method for the enrichment of polyphenol from  EUOL, and the static adsorption, kinetics, isotherm and thermodynamics of the  polyphenol from EUOL were analyzed. The eluted component was obtained through  dynamic elution, and its main polyphenol compounds were detected by high-phase  liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the inhibitory effects on the enzyme activity of  {$\alpha$}-amylase and {$\alpha$}-glucosidase was also evaluated for different elution components.  Meanwhile, the binding of main polyphenol compounds to enzyme was also evaluated.  RESULTS: The selected resins (HPD-300, HPD-600, D-3250, X-5, D-140, NKA-9, D-101  and AB-8) showed adsorption patterns that fitted well to the pseudo second-order  kinetics. The intra-particle diffusion model demonstrated that the diffusion of  polyphenol compounds on these resins were divided into three processes. For  HPD-300, HPD-600 and NKA-9, the Freundlich model better described the adsorption  isotherm behavior than the Langmuir model, and the adsorption of polyphenol was a  physical, exothermic, and spontaneous process. Subsequently, dynamic elution was  performed yielding a higher polyphenol content in a 60\% ethanol-water elution  component, and it also exhibited a higher inhibitory effect on {$\alpha$}-amylase and  {$\alpha$}-glucosidase activity. Furthermore, as the main polyphenol compounds,  chlorogenic acid, rutin, quercetin and kaempferol were used to simulate the  binding to the enzyme protein through molecular docking technology. The results  showed that quercetin had a higher docking score for {$\alpha$}-amylase, while rutin  displayed superior binding to {$\alpha$}-glucosidase. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, polyphenols  of EUOL could be enriched through macroporous resins and have the potential to be  effective enzyme inhibitor.},

Protocatechuic acid (PCA) is an active plant phenolic acid  which exists in Chinese herb, Duzhong (Eucommia ulmoides Oliver), and is also  considered as the main bioactive metabolite of polyphenol against oxidative  stress and inflammation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of PCA on  growth performance, intestinal barrier function, and gut microbiota in a weaned  piglet model challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). METHODS: Thirty-six  piglets (Pig Improvement Company line 337\,\texttimes\,C48, 28 d of age, 8.87\,kg\,{$\pm$}\,0.11\,kg  BW) were randomly allocated into 3 treatments and fed with a basal diet (CTL), a  diet added 50\,mg/kg of aureomycin (AUR), or a diet supplemented with 4000\,mg/kg  of PCA, respectively. The piglets were challenged with LPS (10\,{$\mu$}g/kg BW) on d 14  and d 21 by intraperitoneal injection during the 21-d experiment. Animals (n\,=\,6  from each group) were sacrificed after being anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital  at 2\,h after the last injection of LPS. The serum was collected for antioxidant  indices and inflammatory cytokines analysis, the ileum was harvested for  detecting mRNA and protein levels of tight junction proteins by PCR and  immunohistochemical staining, and the cecum chyme was collected for intestinal  flora analysis using~16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: Dietary supplementation  of PCA or AUR significantly increased the expression of tight junction proteins  including ZO-1 and claudin-1 in intestinal mucosa, and decreased the serum levels  of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and IL-6, as compared with CTL  group. In addition, PCA also decreased the serum levels of IL-2 and TNF-{$\alpha$}  (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Analysis of gut microbiota indicated that PCA increased the  Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Spearman's correlation analysis at the  genus level revealed that PCA reduced the relative abundance of Prevotella 9,  Prevotella 2, Holdemanella, and Ruminococcus torques group (P\,{$<$}\,0.05), and  increased the relative abundance of Roseburia and Desulfovibrio (P\,{$<$}\,0.05),  whereas AUR had no significant effect on these bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: These  results demonstrated that both PCA and AUR had protective effect on oxidative  stress, inflammation and intestinal barrier function in piglets challenged with  LPS, and PCA potentially exerted the protective function by modulating intestinal  flora in a way different from AUR.},

The orthodontic force on the upper right incisor was measured every 24 h  for two weeks using a custom-made measuring device. The force of the Eucommia  elastomer (4.25 {$\pm$} 0.274 N) and multi bracket system (5.32 {$\pm$} 0.338 N) did not  change from the beginning to the end (p {$>$} 0.01). The orthodontic force exerted by  the Eucommia elastomer was lower than that of the multi-bracket orthodontic  appliance from the beginning to the end. The force of Erkodur significantly  decreased from the beginning to 24 h (6.47 {$\pm$} 1.40 N) and 48 h (3.30 {$\pm$} 0.536 N) (p  {$<$} 0.01). The force of Essix C+(\textregistered ) significantly decreased from the beginning  (13.2 {$\pm$} 0.845 N) to 24 h (8.77 {$\pm$} 0.231 N) (p {$<$} 0.01). The thermoplastic  orthodontic appliance made of Eucommia elastomer continuously exerted a constant  orthodontic force for two weeks under water immersion conditions. The orthodontic  force of Eucommia elastomer was found to be similar to the orthodontic force  exerted by the multi-bracket orthodontic appliance with 0.019 \texttimes{} 0.025 in  nickel-titanium wire. These results suggest that the Eucommia elastomer has  possibly become one of the more useful materials to form thermoplastic  orthodontic appliance exerting low continues orthodontic force.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the Chinese health care industry, male Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. flowers are newly approved as a raw material of functional food. Core collections  have been constructed from conserved germplasm resources based on phenotypic  traits and molecular markers. However, little is known about these collections'  phytochemical properties. This study explored the chemical composition of male E.  ulmoides flowers, in order to provide guidance in the quality control,  sustainable cultivation, and directional breeding of this tree species. METHODS:  We assessed the male flowers from 22 core collections using ultra-performance  liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry  (UPLC-QTOF/MS) non-targeted metabolomics, and analyzed them using multivariate  statistical methods including principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical  cluster analysis (HCA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant  analysis (OPLS-DA). RESULTS: We annotated a total of 451 and 325 metabolites in  ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively, by aligning the mass fragments of the  secondary mass spectra with those in the database. Four chemotypes were well  established using the ESI+ metabolomics data. Of the 29 screened biomarkers, 21,  6, 19, and 5 markers corresponded to chemotypes I, II, III, and IV, respectively.  More than half of the markers belonged to flavonoid and amino acid derivative  classes. CONCLUSION: Non-targeted metabolomics is a suitable approach to the  chemotype classification and biomarker screening of male E. ulmoides flower core  collections. We first evaluated the metabolite profiles and compositional  variations of male E. ulmoides flowers in representative core collections before  establishing possible chemotypes and significant biomarkers denoting the  variations. We used genetic variations to infer the metabolite compositional  variations of male E. ulmoides flower core collections instead of using the  geographical origins of the germplasm resources. The newly proposed biomarkers  sufficiently classified the chemotypes to be applied for germplasm resource  evaluation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a disabling disease, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. Increasing evidence has indicated that Chinese  herbal medicine including Eucommia ulmoides (EU) and Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae  (RAB) have potential in the treatment of osteoarthritis, and this is associated  with their multi-target and multi-link action characteristics. Although their  potential anti-arthritic activity has been reported, the exact mechanism of  EU-RAB action in osteoarthritis remains unexplored. Therefore, this study  explores the mechanism of EU-RAB against osteoarthritis using network  pharmacology and molecular docking technology. METHODS: Public databases  including TCMSP、BATMAN-TCM、OMIM and Genecards were used to predict the bioactive  ingredients and putative targets of EU-RAB against osteoarthritis. Enrichment  analysis was performed to expound the biological functions and associated  pathways of the hub targets. Cytoscape software was used to construct a  "compounds-targets-pathways" network for elucidating the comprehensive molecular  mechanism of EU-RAB against osteoarthritis. Molecular docking was used to verify  the correlation between the main active ingredients and hub targets. RESULTS:  Network pharmacological analysis of EU-RAB in the treatment of osteoarthritis,  identified 50 active ingredients including quercetin, kaempferol, wogonin, and  baicalein with important biological effect. A total of 68 key targets were  screened, including IL-6, EGFR, MAPK8, etc., and they were found to be enriched  in a series of signaling pathways, such as apoptosis, TNF, MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and  IL-17 signaling pathways. Moreover, molecular docking analysis showed that the  main ingredients were tightly bound to the core targets, further confirming the  anti-arthritic effects. CONCLUSION: Based on network pharmacology and molecular  docking analysis, the present study provides insights into the potential  mechanism of EU-RAB in osteoarthritis after successfully screening for associated  key target genes and signaling pathways. These findings further provide a  theoretical basis for further pharmacological research into the potential  mechanism of EU-RAB in osteoarthritis.},

Various parts of this  plant such as the bark, leaves, and flowers have been found to have  anti-inflammatory properties. E. ulmoides has potential applications as a  therapeutic agent against bone disorders, which were investigated in this study.  In vitro, RA joint fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLS) were treated with  different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1000\,{$\mu$}g/mL) of E.  ulmoides bark, leaf, and male flower alcoholic extracts (EB, EL, and EF,  respectively) to determine their potential cytotoxicity. Tumor necrosis factor-  (TNF-) {$\alpha$} and nitric oxide (NO) levels in RA-FLS were quantified using  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Furthermore, collagen-induced  arthritis (CIA) rats were treated with EB, EL, EF, Tripterygium wilfordii  polyglycoside (TG) or the normal control (Nor), and then ankle joint pathology,  bone morphology, and serum and spleen inflammatory cytokine levels were  evaluated. The results showed that, in RA-FLS, EB, EL, and EF were not cytotoxic;  EB and EF reduced TNF-{$\alpha$} supernatant levels; and EB, EL, and EF reduced NO levels.  The results of in vivo experiments showed that EB, EL, and EF alleviated ankle  swelling and joint inflammation, while all extracts diminished inflammatory cell  infiltration, pannus and bone destruction, and bone erosion. All tested extracts  inhibited interleukin- (IL-) 6, IL-17, and TNF-{$\alpha$} mRNA in the spleen of CIA rats,  while EB most effectively reduced osteoclasts and inhibited bone erosion. EF  showed the most obvious inhibition of inflammatory factors and pannus. Thus, EB,  EL, and EF may alleviate bone destruction by inhibiting inflammation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been widely promoted as a natural and safe way to treat illness during pregnancy. However, prescription  patterns and factors influencing its use are largely unknown. Therefore, we  conducted a population-based study to address these questions. METHODS: Pregnant  women aged 18-50\,years were selected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance  Research Database between 2001 to 2011. CHM prescriptions and diagnostic records  were collected. Demographic data and pre-existing diseases were compared between  CHM users and non-users. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was  performed to identify possible factors influencing the use of CHM during  pregnancy. RESULTS: A total of 81,873 eligible prescription records were  identified, and 16,553 pregnant women were prescribed CHM during pregnancy,  yielding a CHM prescription rate of 20.2\%. The three most frequently used herbs  were Scutellariae Radix (Huang Qin) (4.4\%), Eucommiae cortex (Du Zhong) (2.5\%),  and Atractylodes Rhizome (Bai Zhu) (2.4\%). The most frequently used herbal  formulae were Dang-Guei-Shao-Yao-San (4.1\%), Jia-Wei-Xiao-Yao-San (3.5\%), and  Xiang-Sha-Liu-Jun-Zi-Tang (2.6\%). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that  subjects with an older age, a university education, a pre-pregnancy history of  CHM use, asthma, chronic renal disease, and cardiac valvular disease and living  in a residential area other than northern Taiwan had an increase in adjusted odds  ratio for CHM use during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study,  we found that demographic factors and pre-existing diseases were associated with  the use of CHM among pregnant women. It is worth noting that Leonuri Herba (Yi Mu  Cao) and Shao-Fu-Zhu-Yu-Tang should be used with caution in the first trimester.  Further research is needed to explore the safety and effectiveness of the use of  CHM in pregnant women.},

Generally, it is empirical to distinguish the  difference between two types of Eucommiae Cortex. The metabolomics coupled with  chemometrics strategy was proposed to filter the combinatorial discriminatory  quality markers for precise distinction and further quality control of the crude  and salt-fired Eucommiae Cortex. The metabolomics data of multiple batches of  Eucommiae Cortex samples was obtained by ultra-high performance liquid  chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Orthogonal partial  least-squares discriminant analysis was utilized to filter candidate markers for  characterizing the obvious difference of the crude and salt-fired Eucommiae  Cortex. The accuracy of combinatorial markers was validated by random forest and  partial least squares regression. Finally, eleven combinatorial discriminatory  quality markers from 67 identified compounds were rapidly screened, identified,  and determined for distinguishing the difference between crude and salt-fired  Eucommiae Cortex. It was demonstrated that UHPLC-MS based metabolomics with  chemometrics was a powerful strategy to screen the combinatorial discriminatory  quality markers for distinguishing the crude and salt-fired Eucommiae Cortex and  to provide the reference for precise quality control of Eucommiae Cortex.},

In this study, we compared  tissue distribution of six representative active components of EC  extract-genipinic acid (GA), protocatechuic acid (PCA), neochlorogenic acid  (NCA), chlorogenic acid (CA), (+)-pinoresinol di-O-{$\beta$}-D-glucopyranoside (PDG), and  (+)-pinoresinol 4'-O-{$\beta$}-D-glucopyranoside (PG)-between normal rats and  spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Each rat was intragastrically given EC  extract at a dose of 5.4\,g/kg. Rats were sacrificed at 10\,min, 30\,min, 2\,h, and  8\,h after administration; six rats were sacrificed at each time point. Then, we  quickly harvested their major organs, including heart, liver, spleen, lungs,  kidneys, and brain. Using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass  spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), we determined the levels of the above mentioned six  components in the organs of both types of rats and then analyzed differences in  the tissue distribution. The results showed that levels of each component  differed between SHRs and the normal group at each time point. As time  progressed, the number of organs in which GA distribution in each tissue of SHRs  differed from that of the normal group gradually increased: SHRs showed lower GA  levels than normal rats. Levels of PG and PDG in both groups at 10 and 30\,min  were similar. NCA and CA in the SHR group and the normal group at 10\,min, 30\,min,  and 2\,h were also similar to some extent. The results indicated that the  pathological state of spontaneous hypertension could affect tissue distribution  of EC active components in rats.},

However, the mechanism underlying these effects has  rarely been reported, and whether EUP can reduce liver injury in hepatic  ischemia-reperfusion injury (HIRI) has not been reported. In this study, 40  Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: the sham group,  ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) group, and three EUP pretreatment groups (320\,mg/kg,  160\,mg/kg, and 80\,mg/kg). SD rats were pretreated with EUP by gavage once a day  prior to I/R injury for 10 days. Except for the sham group, blood flow in the  middle and left liver lobes was blocked in all the other groups, resulting in 70\%  liver ischemia, and the ischemia and reperfusion times were 1\,h and 4\,h,  respectively. Ischemic liver tissue and serum were obtained to detect biochemical  markers and liver histopathological damage. Compared with the I/R group, after  EUP pretreatment, serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase,  tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}, and interleukin-1{$\beta$} levels were significantly decreased,  malondialdehyde levels in liver tissues were significantly decreased, superoxide  dismutase levels were significantly increased, and the area of liver necrosis was  notably reduced. To understand the specific mechanism involved, we determined the  levels of Toll-like receptor- (TLR-) 4-nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-{$\kappa$}B)  pathway-associated proteins in vivo and in vitro. The data showed that EUP can  reduce liver damage by decreasing ROS levels and inhibiting TLR-4-NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway  activation and may be a promising drug in liver surgery to prevent HIRI.},

EUG and  sugars were obtained through the white rot fungal pretreatment of E. ulmoides  leaves, ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction, and enzymatic saccharification.  After mere 2-day fermentation, the loss of lignin, cellulose, and hemicelluloses  of the leaves achieved 7.11\%, 3.47\%, and 6.44\%, respectively due to the high  activity levels of manganese peroxidase (MnP, 973 IU g(-1)) and lignin peroxidase  (LiP, 1341 IU g(-1)) produced by the fungus. The breakdown of fibrous networks  brought higher yields of EUG and reducing sugars. The highest extraction yield of  EUG was 4.86\% from the 2-day fermented leaves, 31.4\% greater than that from the  control (3.69\%). Meanwhile, the leaf residues after EUG extraction released 97.8  mg g(-1) reducing sugars with enzymatic saccharification, 77.5\% greater than that  from the control (55.1 mg g(-1)). The results demonstrated that I. obliquus could  use E. ulmoides leaves as substrate to produce high-activity-level ligninolytic  enzymes in a very short time and the lignocellulose selective degradation of E.  ulmoides leaves enhanced the yields of EUG and reducing sugars.},

Nevertheless, its dioecious  property hinders sex recognition by traditional morphological observation at very  early developmental stages, thus inhibiting breeding and economic cropping. In  this study, double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq)  was applied to screen sex-linked molecular markers for sex identification and  investigation of the sex determination system in 20 male and female E. ulmoides  individual plants, respectively. In consequence, five candidate male-specific  loci but no female-specific loci were predicated among the 183,752 male and  147,122 female catalogue loci by bioinformatics analysis. Subsequent PCR  (polymerase chain reaction) amplification and Sanger sequencing examinations were  performed on another 24 individuals, 12 for each sex, from a separate population.  One ideal sex-linked locus, MSL4, was identified among the five putative  male-specific loci that were found using ddRAD data. MSL4 is 479\,bp in length and  highly conserved in all the male individuals, suggesting its feature of being  stable and repeatable. Our results also indicated that the sex of E. ulmoides is  likely determined genetically. In short, this study provides a consistent and  reproducible ddRAD marker (MSL4) that is able to discriminate male from female  seedlings in E. ulmoides, which will be valuable for rapid breeding practice and  better commercial production of this economically important tree.},

However,  clarifying the differences in pharmacological effects of different parts of EU is  of great significance for the development of EU products, and their corresponding  active components provide basis for quality control of different parts of EU.  Based on the chemical compositions of different parts of EU, integrated strategy  of target prediction and target analysis of the compounds was used to investigate  the difference in the pharmacological effects of leaves, barks and followers. The  "component-target-function" association network was constructed to mine the  specific material basis corresponding to specific efficacy of different parts of  EU. In this study, the author found that EU may have the activities of  anti-oxidation, neuromodulation, blood pressure regulation, myo-cardial  expansion, and anti-apoptosis according to target prediction and function  analysis. However, the effects of different parts of EU were different. Leaves  were involved in the process of bone development such as osteoblast  differentiation and bone mineralization in a specific way. In addition, the  leaves may affect the process of bone development by regulating the metabolism of  vitamin D and affecting the absorption of calcium. Leaves may also specifically  act on estrogen and estradiol response processes where estrogen receptors were  involved. Regarding its protective function for the liver, leaves may play a role  by regulating vitamin A-related pathways. As compared with leaves, the specific  pharmacological effects of barks may be related to the development of the urinary  system. Flowers specifically participate in functions related to pain sensation,  glutamate signaling pathway, and excitatory postsynaptic potential. Based on the  hie-rarchical network of "component-target-pathway", we further found that  specific activities of different parts of EU were inseparable from its specific  chemical compositions. Phenylpropanoids, terpenoids and rings, iridoids,  flavonoids and other components which are specific in leaves can target the  specific effects of leaves, while the flavonoids in barks and the quinones in  flowers may be the material basis for their respective specific effects. The  prediction of the activities of different parts of EU provides a new basis for  the focuses and differences in subsequent Eucommia product development. At the  same time, the material basis research based on differential efficacy also  provides a basis for the quality control of Eucommia differentiated products.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., a Chinese medicinal herb called "Duzhong" from the bark of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., has been shown to  possess significant protective effects in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the  molecular mechanism remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we explored  the anti-neuroinflammatory mechanisms of Duzhong on the  1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model to  elucidate the traditional medical theories with modern pharmacological methods  and to provide a reference for further clarifying its mechanisms of action.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: The representative components in Duzhong extract were  identified by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS. Male C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected  with MPTP to establish an in vivo PD model. The pole, rotarod, and grip strength  tests were performed to evaluate the motor coordination ability of the PD mice.  HPLC-ECD was used to detect the striatal levels of dopamine (DA), 3,4-  dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA). The expression of  tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western  blot assays. ELISA and Q-PCR were used examined the levels of proinflammatory  cytokines in the serum and midbrain, respectively. Whole-transcriptome analysis  of the midbrain was performed to explore the therapeutic effect of Duzhong on PD  mice, and Q-PCR was then used to validate the differential gene expression  changes in the PD mice treated with Duzhong. RESULTS: Ten compounds were  identified from Duzhong extract. Duzhong significantly alleviated the behavioral  impairments and dopaminergic neuron degeneration of PD mice, and inhibited the  expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Whole-transcriptome analysis revealed  nine oppositely regulated genes, and the Fosl2 gene was consistent with the trend  of observed by RNA-seq. Furthermore, Duzhong downregulated mRNA expression of p38  and JNK, which are key upstream genes of Fosl2. CONCLUSIONS: Duzhong has  promising therapeutic potential in PD mice, and its molecular mechanism is  mediated by downregulating p38/JNK-Fosl2 gene expression to alleviate  neuroinflammation.},

This  review recapitulates recent advances of CGAs in the cardiovascular-preserving  effects, pharmacokinetics, sources, and safety. Emerging evidence indicates that  CGAs exhibit circulatory guarding properties through the suppression of oxidative  stress, leukocyte infiltration, platelet aggregation, platelet-leukocyte  interactions, vascular remodeling, and apoptosis as well as the regulation of  glucose and lipid metabolism and vasodilatory action in the cardiovascular  system. CGAs exert these effects by acting on complex signaling networks, but the  global mechanisms are still not clear. The oral bioavailability of CGA is poor,  and there is a potential sensitization concern about CGA. The bioactive  metabolites, systematic toxicity, and optimized structure are needed for further  identification.},

By single factor  orthogonal test, it was found that under optimal fermentation conditions (bran  addition 10\%, sugar addition 8\%, leaven addition 0.3\% and acetic acid bacteria  solution 12\%), the acetic acid content and CA content of EV were 45.5\,{$\pm$}\,2.8~mg/mL  and 0.98\,{$\pm$}\,0.08~mg/mL, respectively. Then, by the disc diffusion method, it was  concluded that the antibacterial effect of EV was significantly higher than that  of Eucommia ulmoides leaves enzymatic hydrolysate and Zhenjiang aromatic vinegar  (P{$<$}0.05). An investigation into action mode of EV against Bacillus subtilis  indicated that, under the combined action of CA and acetic acid, EV exerted its  antibacterial effect by damaging bacterial cell wall and cell membrane,  increasing the cell permeability which resulted in the structural lesions and  release of cell components, thus led to cell death.},

Chronic systemic  exposure to rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, could reproduce many  features of PD. However, the adoption of the models is limiting because of  variability in animal sensitivity and the inability of other investigators to  consistently reproduce the PD neuropathology. In addition, most of rotenone  models were produced in rats. Here, we tried to establish a high-reproducible  rotenone model using C57BL/6J mice. The rotenone mouse model was produced by  chronic systemic exposure to a low dose of rotenone (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 4 weeks  by subcutaneous implantation of rotenone-filled osmotic mini pump. The  rotenone-treated mice exhibited motor deficits assessed by open field, rotarod  and cylinder test and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Rotenone treatment decreased  the number of dopaminergic neuronal cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta  (SNpc) and lesioned nerve terminal in the striatum. In addition, we observed  significant reduction of cholinergic neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the  vagus (DMV) and the intestinal myenteric plexus. Moreover, {$\alpha$}-synuclein was  accumulated in neuronal soma in the SNpc, DMV and intestinal myenteric plexus in  rotenone-treated mice. These data suggest that the low-dose rotenone mouse model  could reproduce behavioral and central and peripheral neurodegenerative features  of PD and be a useful model for investigation of PD pathogenesis.},

In this study, water-in-oil (W/O) microemulsions composed of  Eucommia ulmoides Oliver seed oil, distilled water, a blend of Sorbitan  monooleate 80 (Span 80) and Polysorbate (20) sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), and  propylene glycol were prepared for improving the compatibility of Eucommia  ulmoides Oliver seed oil. Pseudoternary phase diagrams were built to illustrate  the phase behavior of the microemulsions, based on hydrophilic-lipophilic balance  values, cosurfactant type, the proportion of cosurfactant, and the changing  environmental stress. Dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy,  and electrical conductivity measurements were performed to characterize the  microstructural aspects. The optimum process conditions at which the Eucommia  ulmoides Oliver seed oil-loaded microemulsion had good tolerance to pH and  salinity were: Propylene glycol served as cosurfactant, water-Propylene glycol,  and Span 80-Tween 80 ratios separately kept constant at 1:1 and 6:4. These  microemulsions with narrow size distribution, nanoscale particle size (below  60~nm), transparent appearance had a wide range of oil phase content and  free-radical scavenging capacity toward DPPH and ABTS radicals with half-maximal  inhibitory concentration (IC(50) ) values of 49.20 and 33.43~mg/mL, respectively.  PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This nanostructure, environmental stability, and  antioxidant activity of microemulsions containing Eucommia ulmoides Oliver seed  oil is a potential delivery system as an alternative to {$\alpha$}-linolenic acid and can  be used for the delivery of peptides, proteins, antioxidants, and water-soluble  nutrients.},

One of the  potential mechanisms responsible for this was the decrease in oxidative stress,  as evidenced by the increase in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD),  glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the  small intestine. Puerarin increased the protein expression levels of  NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream enzymes, including heme  oxygenase 1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic and its modifier subunit  (GCLc and GCLm) in the jejunal mucosa of diquat-induced piglets.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: 7-Hydroxycoumarin (7-HC), also known as umbelliferon, is commonly found in Chinese herbs (e.g. Eucommiae Cortex, Prunellae Spica, Radix Angelicae  Biseratae). Previous laboratory studies have indicated that 7-HC has  anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-tumor effects. Cisplatin is a widely  used chemotherapeutic agent for cancer. Nephrotoxicity is one of the limiting  side effects of cisplatin use. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the  renoprotective effect of 7-HC in a cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI)  mouse model. METHODS: AKI was induced in male C57BL/6 mice (aged 6-8 weeks) by a  single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin at 20~mg/kg. The mice received 7-HC  at 30, 60, and 90~mg/kg intraperitoneally before or after cisplatin  administration. Renal function, necroptosis, and cell proliferation were  measured. Mechanisms underlying the reno-protective effect of 7-HC were explored  in renal tubular epithelial cells treated with or without cisplatin. RESULTS:  In-vivo experiments showed that 7-HC significantly improved the loss in kidney  function induced by cisplatin, as indicated by lower levels of serum creatinine  and blood urea nitrogen, in AKI mice. Consistent herewith, cisplatin-induced  tubular damage was alleviated by 7-HC as shown by morphological (periodic  acid-Schiff staining) and kidney injury marker (KIM-1) analyses. We found that  7-HC suppressed renal necroptosis via the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL pathway and  accelerated renal repair as evidenced by the upregulation of cyclin D1 in  cisplatin-induced nephropathy. In-vitro experiments showed that knockdown of Sox9  attenuated the suppressive effect of 7-HC on KIM-1 and reversed the stimulatory  effect of 7-HC on cyclin D1 expression in cisplatin-treated HK-2 cells,  indicating that 7-HC may protect against AKI via a Sox9-dependent mechanism.  CONCLUSION: 7-HC inhibits cisplatin-induced AKI by suppressing  RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-mediated necroptosis and promoting Sox9-mediated tubular  epithelial cell proliferation. 7-HC may serve as a preventive and therapeutic  agent for AKI.},

  abstract = {Eucommia ulmoides is traditional Chinese medicine, and it possesses several potential bioactivities, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immune  regulatory activities. This study was conducted to determine the effects of  dietary Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts (ELE) on growth performance, antioxidant  capacity and intestinal function of weaned piglets. Two hundred crossbred  (Duroc~\texttimes ~Landrace~\texttimes ~Yorkshire) piglets with an average initial weight of  12.96~{$\pm~$}0.28~kg were randomly allotted to five treatments: C0 (basal diet), C1  (basal diet~+~antibiotics) and basal diet supplemented with increasing levels of  ELE (0.2, 0.3 or 0.4~g/kg of feed). The results showed that ELE or antibiotics  supplementation remarkably decreased diarrhoea rate and 0.3~g/kg ELE increased  average daily gain compared with C0 (p~{$<~$}.05). 0.3~g/kg ELE increased alkaline  phosphatase (AKP) levels and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in serum and  liver, as well as increased the content of serum albumin and total protein (TP)  compared with the C0 (p~{$<~$}.05). The lipase activity of duodenum content and  trypsin activity of jejunum content were improved fed diets containing 0.3~g/kg  ELE compared with C0 (p~{$<~$}.05). The 0.3~g/kg ELE treatments have a higher villus  height of the duodenum and jejunum compared with the C0 (p~{$<~$}.05). These results  suggested that ELE supplementation had beneficial effects on antioxidant and  intestinal function in weaned piglets, which also could increase growth  performance and decreased diarrhoea rate. Accordingly, ELE is a potential  alternative to antibiotics.},

RF models constructed by high-level data fusion with  different modes of different spectral data (Fourier transform near-infrared  spectrum and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform mid-infrared spectrum)  were most suitable for identifying EULs from different geographical origins. The  accuracy rates of calibration and validation set were 92.86\% and 93.44\%,  respectively. In addition, climate parameters were systematically investigated  the cluster difference in our study. Some interesting and novel information could  be found from the clustering tree diagram of hierarchical cluster analysis. The  Xinjiang Autonomous Region (Region 5) located in the high latitude area was the  only region in the middle temperate zone of all sample collection areas in which  the samples belonged to an individual class no matter their distance in the tree  diagram. The samples were from a relatively high elevation in the Shennongjia  Forest District in Hubei Province ({$>$}1200 m), which is the main difference from  the samples from Xiangyang City (78 m). Thus, the sample clusters from region 9  are different from the sample clusters from other regions. The results would  provide a reference for further research to those samples from the special  cluster.},

Transcript  profiles of two tissues from E. ulmoides cv. Qinzhong No. 3, leaf and fruit, were  analysed using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system. In total, 104 million clean reads  were obtained and assembled into 58,863 unigenes. Through gene functional  classification, 28,091 unigenes (47.72\%) were annotated and 65 unigenes have been  hypothesized to encode proteins involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. In addition,  10,041 unigenes were detected as differentially expressed unigenes, and 29 of  them were putatively related to terpenoid biosynthesis. The synthesis of  trans-polyisoprene rubbers in E. ulmoides was hypothesised to be dominated by the  mevalonate pathway. Farnesyl diphosphate synthase 2 (FPPS2) was considered a key  component in the biosynthesis of trans-polyprenyl diphosphate. Rubber elongation  factor 3 (REF3) might be involved in stabilising the membrane of rubber particles  in E. ulmoides. To date, 351 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were validated as  polymorphisms from eight E. ulmoides plants (two parent plants and six F(1)  individuals), and these could act as molecular markers for genetic map density  increase and breeding improvement of E. ulmoides.},

Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (EuO) is widely used as a traditional herb to  treat various diseases. EuO bark extracts have been reported to possess anti-PD  activity. Here, we investigated whether extracts of EuO leaves (EEuOL) also have  therapeutic effects on PD since similar components and clinical applications have  been found between barks and leaves of this tree. We identified the chemical  composition of EEuOL by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS and tested the anti-PD effect of EEuOL  using the zebrafish PD model. As a result, 28 compounds including 3 phenolic  acids, 7 flavonoids, and 9 iridoids were identified. EEuOL significantly reversed  the loss of dopaminergic neurons and neural vasculature and reduced the number of  apoptotic cells in zebrafish brain in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover,  EEuOL relieved locomotor impairments in MPTP-modeled PD zebrafish. We also  investigated the underlying mechanism and found that EEuOL may activate  autophagy, contributing to {$\alpha$}-synuclein degradation, therefore alleviating PD-like  symptoms. Molecular docking simulation implied the interaction between autophagy  regulators (Pink1, Beclin1, Ulk2, and Atg5) and phenolic acids of EEuOL,  affirming the involvement of autophagy in EEuOL-exerted anti-PD action. The  overall results indicated the anti-PD effect of EEuOL, opening the possibility to  use the extract in PD treatment.},

Osteonecrosis is a disabling disorder that  frequently occurs in the younger population aged from 20-50 years. The compound  Eucommia bone tonic granules, a traditional Chinese medicine, can alleviate the  damage of osteoarthritis and osteonecrosis. AIM: To investigate the potential  role of the compound Eucommia bone tonic granules (Eucommia) in the treatment of  patients with osteoarthritis and osteonecrosis. METHODS: One-hundred forty  osteoarthritis and osteonecrosis cases admitted to our hospital from January 2013  to December 2017 were selected. Patients were divided into two groups:  Eucommia-meloxicam group and meloxicam group. Clinical efficacy and the Western  Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) score were evaluated  according to the evaluation criteria of orthopedic diseases. The levels of  bone-GLA protein, interleukin-17, recombinant human S100 calcium binding protein  A12, sphingosine 1-phosphate, cystatin C, creatinine, and hemoglobin in  peripheral blood were determined. RESULTS: The total effective rate in the two  osteoarthritis groups was not different, but the total effective rate in the two  osteonecrosis groups was significantly different. The overall efficacy of  Eucommia-meloxicam group was superior to that of the meloxicam group. WOMAC  showed that pain, stiffness, and dysfunction in the two groups of osteoarthritis  and osteonecrosis before and after treatment were significantly different. The  concentration of recombinant human S100 calcium binding protein A12, sphingosine  1-phosphate, cystatin C, creatinine, and hemoglobin before and after treatment in  the Eucommia-meloxicam group and meloxicam group of osteoarthritis and  osteonecrosis were significantly different, and the two treatment groups were  significantly different from each other for osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: Our  findings indicate that Eucommia can effectively enhance the curative effect of  meloxicam, and the combination of Eucommia and meloxicam is superior to meloxicam  alone.},

However, cross-linking may exert  a trade-off effect between the strength and the stretchability, and the  heterogeneous nucleation of percolation fillers may change the crystalline  behavior in an undesirable way and may decrease the toughness. We thus focused on  exploring a method to increase the elastic properties of crystallizable polymers  with no strength decrease. Using cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) with high  percolation properties due to their high aspect ratio, we integrated the two  strategies of cross-link and percolation to improve the full mechanical  properties of eucommia ulmoide gum (EUG), a sustainable polymer, for developing  green composite materials. The crystallinity of EUG could decrease to 22\% with  thiol-functionalized CNCs (mCNCs), solving the urgent problem of EUG on its  inevitably high crystallinity from its trans-double bonds. The  thiol-functionalization was to offer CNC chemical activity to cross-link with  EUG, which limited the segment movement of the EUG around CNC and decrease the  heterogeneous nucleating ability of CNC. Then, the strength and elongation at  break of EUG-based nanocomposite maximally increased to 16.2 MPa and 498\%,  respectively. Such an EUG-based material was prepared with biomass resources and  was a qualified candidate for sustainable elastomers, which was of high  industrial potential in packing materials.},

However, whether GPA could alleviate memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease  animal models is not clear. We aimed to investigate the effect of GPA treatment  on cognitive performance, A{$\beta$} deposition and glial cells activation in the  transgenic mouse model of AD. 6-7 months APP/PS1 mice were given GPA for 90 days;  behavioral experiments were executed to estimate the memory and spatial learning  abilities of mice, and the mechanism of neuroprotective effect of GPA was  investigated with a focus on amyloid-{$\beta$} deposition, astrocytes and microglia  activation and neuroinflammation. GPA treatment significantly improved the  spatial learning and memory abilities and also decreased cerebral amyloid-{$\beta$}  deposition in APP/PS1 mice. Via HE staining, we found that GPA could ameliorate  histopathological changes in cerebrum. We also found that GPA treatment inhibited  the activation of astrocytes and microglia, down-regulated the expression of  pro-inflammatory cytokines and iNOS, and up-regulated the expression of  anti-inflammatory cytokines and Arg-1. In addition, GPA down-regulated the gene  expression of HMGB-1 receptors (TLR2, TLR4 and RAGE) then mediated MyD88, TRAF6  and phospho-ERK1/2, subsequently modulated the expression of key AP-1 and NF-{$\kappa$}B  family members (c-Fos, c-Jun and p65).

This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the source,  biological activity, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of aucubin with the ultimate  objective of providing a guide for future drug development and potential clinical  applications of aucubin. Aucubin is a highly active compound possessing extensive  biological effects including antioxidant, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory,  anti-fibrotic, anti-cancer, hepatoprotective, neuroprotective and osteoprotective  properties. Although aucubin has been shown to have poor oral bioavailability in  rats, aucubin is widely distributed in multiple organs including kidney, liver,  heart, spleen and lung, and there is a sex difference in the absorption of  aucubin. Tolerance of aucubin is good and no serious adverse reactions have been  observed to date. In short, aucubin is a compound with abundant potential  sources, good safety and numerous beneficial biological activities, which  exhibits high potential value for use in health care products and  pharmaceuticals. In order to accelerate the development and utilization of  aucubin-related products, in-depth studies should be focused on the following  questions of interest. First, it is necessary to introduce advanced separation  and formulation technologies to improve the yield and stability of aucubin  products. Second, studies should focus on the specific pharmacological activities  of aucubin to determine the structure-activity relationship so as to improve the  efficacy and reduce side effects. Finally, clinical studies are needed to confirm  the efficacy of aucubin in specific diseases.},

  abstract = {Hydrosoluble trehalose lipid (a biosurfactant) was employed for the first time as a green extraction solution to extract the main antioxidant compounds  (geniposidic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and rutin) from functional  plant tea (Eucommia ulmoides leaves). Single-factor tests and response surface  methodology were employed to optimize the extraction conditions for  ultrasound-assisted micellar extraction combined with ultra-high-performance  liquid chromatography in succession. A Box-Behnken design (three-level,  three-factorial) was used to determine the effects of extraction solvent  concentration (1-5~mg/mL), extraction solvent volume (5-15~mL), and extraction  time (20-40~min) at a uniform ultrasonic power and temperature. In consequence,  the best analyte extraction yields could be attained when the trehalose lipid  solution concentration was prepared at 3~mg/mL, the trehalose lipid solution  volume was 10~mL and the extraction time was set to 35~min. In addition, the  recoveries of the antioxidants from Eucommia ulmoides leaves analyzed by this  analytical method ranged from 98.2 to 102\%. These results indicated that  biosurfactant-enhanced ultrasound-assisted micellar extraction coupled with a  simple ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography method could be effectively  applied in the extraction and analysis of antioxidants from Eucommia ulmoides  leaf samples.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the  antihypertensive effect of DJT and amlodipine besylate (AB) on the synergistic  treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and to explore its  antihypertensive mechanism. The synergistic therapeutic effect of DJT in  combination with AB on SHR was studied using two metabolomics methods based on  mass spectrum (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance. Metabolomics analysis of  plasma, urine, liver, and kidney and the combination of orthogonal partial least  squares discriminant analysis was performed to expose potential biomarkers. Then,  the overall metabolic characteristics and related abnormal metabolic pathways in  hypertensive rats were constructed. Blood pressure measurements showed that DJT  combined with AB has better effects in treating hypertension than it being alone.  A total of 30 biomarkers were identified, indicating that hypertension disrupted  the balance of multiple metabolic pathways in the body, and that combined  administration restored metabolite levels better than their administration alone.  The changes of biomarkers revealed the synergistic therapeutic mechanism of DJT  combined with AB, which provided a reference for the combination of Chinese and  Western medicines.},

In these  applications, the cell-delivery vehicle plays a crucial role in determining the  therapeutic performance of MSCs and their fate post-implantation. We report here  the development of a microcarrier system combining platelet-derived growth  factor-BB (PDGF-BB) and a PDGF-BB-binding polysaccharide - Eucommia ulmoides  (EUP3) - for MSC cultivation. First, we investigated the optimal conditions to  prepare the EUP3-PDGF-BB complex, by comparing its i) diameter, ii) morphology,  and iii) bioactivity to promote MSC proliferation and fibroblast migration in  vitro, under different PDGF-BB/EUP3 ratios. Then, we fabricated microspheres  using gelatin and EUP3 as the matrix while stabilizing PDGF-BB at the optimal  ratio for MSC adhesion and growth. Live staining and SEM observation indicated  that the prepared microspheric carrier supported MSC growth and maintained cell  stemness. We suggest that the EUP3/PDGF-gelatin microcarriers can potentially  serve as a cell-delivery vehicle for tissue engineering.},

This study evaluated the effect of  Illicium verum extracts (IVE) or Eucommia ulmoides leaf extracts (ELE) on growth  performance, serum and liver antioxidant ability of nursery piglets, as well as  the difference of IVE and ELE on Duroc~\texttimes ~Landrace~\texttimes ~Yorkshire (DLY) and Chinese  native Licha-black (LCB) piglets. A total of 96 nursery piglets (48 DLY and 48  LCB piglets) with an average body weight of 11.22~{$\pm~$}0.32~kg were randomly divided  into four treatments in a 2~\texttimes ~4 factorial design. Each treatment had four  replicates with 3 DLY and 3 LCB piglets per replicate respectively. Treatments  included: basal diet, basal diet~+~500~mg/kg IVE, basal diet~+~250~mg/kg ELE and  basal diet~+~50~mg/kg chlortetracycline (CHL). All piglets were housed  individually for the 42~days trial period after 7~days adaptation. Results showed  that there were significant interactions (p~{$<~$}.05) between piglets species and  dietary treatments in average daily gain (ADG) and feed efficiency, serum and  hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and malondialdehyde (MDA), hepatic  integral optical density (IOD) of {$\alpha$}-tumour necrosis factor (TNF-{$\alpha$}), hepatic  relative mRNA expressions of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2  (Nrf2)/TNF-{$\alpha$} and protein expression of TNF-{$\alpha$}. Regardless of piglets species,  supplementation with IVE and ELE increased (p~{$<~$}.05) ADG and feed efficiency,  T-SOD and GSH-Px in serum and liver, hepatic IOD of Nrf2, hepatic mRNA and  protein expression of Nrf2/TNF-{$\alpha$}. However, CHL treatment resulted in lower  (p~{$<~$}.05) serum GSH-Px and hepatic mRNA and protein expression of Nrf2/TNF-{$\alpha$}, and  higher hepatic MDA and IOD of TNF-{$\alpha$}. Compared to LCB, DLY piglets had higher  (p~{$<~$}.05) ADG and feed efficiency, serum and hepatic MDA, and protein expression  of TNF-{$\alpha$}, but lower (p~{$<~$}.05) ADFI, liver index, serum and hepatic GSH-Px,  hepatic IOD of TNF-{$\alpha$}, mRNA expressions of Nrf2/TNF-{$\alpha$} were observed. In  conclusion, Illicium verum (500~mg/kg) and Eucommia ulmoides leaf (250~mg/kg)  extracts can increase the growth performance and antioxidant ability of DLY and  LCB piglets, while chlortetracycline produces undesirable side-effects on the  antioxidant ability of DLY and LCB piglets. Illicium verum and Eucommia ulmoides  leaf extracts produced different antioxidant effects in DLY and LCB piglets with  the Chinese native Licha-black pig responding better than  Duroc~\texttimes ~Landrace~\texttimes ~Yorkshire.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) enables rapid chemical annotation via accurate mass measurements and matching of experimentally derived spectra with reference spectra. Reference libraries are generated from chemical standards and are therefore limited in size relative to known chemical space. To address this limitation, in silico spectra (i.e., MS/MS or MS2 spectra), predicted via Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID) algorithms, were generated for compounds within the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Distributed Structure-Searchable Toxicity (DSSTox) database (totaling, at the time of analysis, \textasciitilde\,765,000 substances). Experimental spectra from EPA's Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT) mixtures (               n               \,=\,10) were then used to evaluate the performance of the in silico spectra. Overall, MS2 spectra were acquired for 377 unique compounds from the ENTACT mixtures. Approximately 53\% of these compounds were correctly identified using a commercial reference library, whereas up to 50\% were correctly identified as the top hit using the in silico library. Together, the reference and in silico libraries were able to correctly identify 73\% of the 377 ENTACT substances. When using the in silico spectra for candidate filtering, an examination of binary classifiers showed a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.90 associated with false positive rates (FPRs) of 0.10 to 0.85, depending on the sample and method of candidate filtering. Taken together, these findings show the abilities of in silico spectra to correctly identify true positives in complex samples (at rates comparable to those observed with reference spectra), and efficiently filter large numbers of potential false positives from further consideration.},

  abstract = {Marine microbes are known to degrade hydrocarbons; however, microbes inhabiting deep-sea sediments remain largely unexplored. Previous studies into the classical  pathways of marine microbial metabolism reveal diverse chemistries; however,  metabolic profiling of marine microbes cultured with hydrocarbons is limited. In  this study, taxonomic (amplicon sequencing) profiles of two environmental  deep-sea sediments ({$>$}1,200 m deep) were obtained, along with taxonomic and  metabolomic (mass spectrometry-based metabolomics) profiles of microbes harbored  in deep-sea sediments cultured with hydrocarbons as the sole energy source.  Samples were collected from the Gulf of M\'exico (GM) and cultured for 28\,days  using simple (toluene, benzene, hexadecane, and naphthalene) and complex  (petroleum API 40) hydrocarbon mixtures as the sole energy sources. The sediment  samples harbored diverse microbial communities predominantly classified into  Woeseiaceae and Kiloniellaceae families, whereas Pseudomonadaceae and  Enterobacteriaceae families prevailed after sediments were cultured with  hydrocarbons. Chemical profiling of microbial metabolomes revealed diverse  chemical groups belonging primarily to the lipids and lipid-like molecules  superclass, as well as the organoheterocyclic compound superclass (ClassyFire  annotation). Metabolomic data and prediction of functional profiles indicated an  increase in aromatic and alkane degradation in samples cultured with  hydrocarbons. Previously unreported metabolites, identified as intermediates in  the degradation of hydrocarbons, were annotated as hydroxylated polyunsaturated  fatty acids and carboxylated benzene derivatives. In summary, this study used  mass spectrometry-based metabolomics coupled to chemoinformatics to demonstrate  how microbes from deep-sea sediments could be cultured in the presence of  hydrocarbons. This study also highlights how this experimental approach can be  used to increase the understanding of hydrocarbon degradation by deep-sea  sediment microbes.IMPORTANCE High-throughput technologies and emerging  informatics tools have significantly advanced knowledge of hydrocarbon metabolism  by marine microbes. However, research into microbes inhabiting deep-sea sediments  ({$>$}1,000 m) is limited compared to those found in shallow waters. In this study, a  nontargeted and nonclassical approach was used to examine the diversity of  bacterial taxa and the metabolic profiles of hydrocarbon-degrading deep-sea  microbes. In conclusion, this study used metabolomics and chemoinformatics to  demonstrate that microbes from deep-sea sediment origin thrive in the presence of  toxic and difficult-to-metabolize hydrocarbons. Notably, this study provides  evidence of previously unreported metabolites and the global chemical repertoire  associated with the metabolism of hydrocarbons by deep-sea microbes.},

  abstract = {Background:               With significant clinical effects, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been attracting increasing interest of the world's scientific community. However, TCM contains immense amounts of chemical components. It is a great challenge to objectively evaluate the correlation between the in vivo process and the therapeutic effect of TCM. The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the recent investigation (from 2017 to 2019) on preclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) of TCM via liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).                                         Method:               We reviewed the published articles regarding the PK of TCM by LC-MS/MS. In addition, we summarized information on PK parameter of bioactive components, single herb and traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions.                                         Results:               The vast majority of literature on preclinical PK of TCM uses single oral administration, the biological matrix is mostly rat plasma, and the main PK parameters include AUC, Cmax, Tmax and T1/2, etc.                                         Conclusion:               Although LC-MS/MS can be used for high-throughput analysis, the characterization of in vivo processes of TCM still has a long way. With the advantages of high sensitivity, high specificity and simple operation, the increasingly mature LC-MS/MS technology will play an important role in the PK study of TCM.},

We identify a major shift between mild and moderate disease, at which point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied by the loss of specific classes of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within this stressed plasma environment at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune cell phenotypes emerge and amplify with increasing disease severity. We condensed over 120,000 immune features into a single axis to capture how different immune cell classes coordinate in response to SARS-CoV-2. This immune-response axis independently aligns with the major plasma composition changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that moderate disease may provide the most effective setting for therapeutic intervention.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are increased via unknown mechanisms in patients with diabetes and kidney disease. SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into host cells. Because ACE2 is a susceptibility factor for infection, we investigated how diabetic kidney disease and medications alter ACE2 receptor expression in kidneys. Single cell RNA profiling of kidney biopsies from healthy living donors and patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell-specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public -omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing. The diabetic kidney disease ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cell module overlapped with expression patterns seen in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Similar cellular programs were seen in ACE2-positive proximal tubular epithelial cells obtained from urine samples of 13 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated proximal tubular epithelial cell expression program that may interact with the SARS-CoV-2 infection processes. Thus SARS-CoV-2 receptor networks can seed further research into risk stratification and therapeutic strategies for COVID-19-related kidney damage.},

  abstract = {Lysophosphatidylcholines are a group of bioactive lipids heavily investigated in the context of inflammation and atherosclerosis development. While present in plasma during physiological conditions, their concentration can drastically increase in certain inflammatory states. Lysophosphatidylcholines are widely regarded as potent pro-inflammatory and deleterious mediators, but an increasing number of more recent studies show multiple beneficial properties under various pathological conditions. Many of the discrepancies in the published studies are due to the investigation of different species or mixtures of lysophatidylcholines and the use of supra-physiological concentrations in the absence of serum or other carrier proteins. Furthermore, interpretation of the results is complicated by the rapid metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in cells and tissues to pro-inflammatory lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly, most of the recent studies, in contrast to older studies, found lower LPC plasma levels associated with unfavorable disease outcomes. Being the most abundant lysophospholipid in plasma, it is of utmost importance to understand its physiological functions and shed light on the discordant literature connected to its research. LPCs should be recognized as important homeostatic mediators involved in all stages of vascular inflammation. In this review, we want to point out potential pro- and anti-inflammatory activities of lysophospholipids in the vascular system and highlight recent discoveries about the effect of lysophosphatidylcholines on immune cells at the endothelial vascular interface. We will also look at their potential clinical application as biomarkers.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Molecular fingerprints are essential cheminformatics tools for virtual screening and mapping chemical space. Among the different types of fingerprints, substructure fingerprints perform best for small molecules such as drugs, while atom-pair fingerprints are preferable for large molecules such as peptides. However, no available fingerprint achieves good performance on both classes of molecules.                                         Results                                Here we set out to design a new fingerprint suitable for both small and large molecules by combining substructure and atom-pair concepts. Our quest resulted in a new fingerprint called MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint up to a diameter of four bonds (MAP4). In this fingerprint the circular substructures with radii of                 r                 \,=\,1 and                 r\,                 =\,2 bonds around each atom in an atom-pair are written as two pairs of SMILES, each pair being combined with the topological distance separating the two central atoms. These so-called atom-pair molecular shingles are hashed, and the resulting set of hashes is MinHashed to form the MAP4 fingerprint. MAP4 significantly outperforms all other fingerprints on an extended benchmark that combines the Riniker and Landrum small molecule benchmark with a peptide benchmark recovering BLAST analogs from either scrambled or point mutation analogs. MAP4 furthermore produces well-organized chemical space tree-maps (TMAPs) for databases as diverse as DrugBank, ChEMBL, SwissProt and the Human Metabolome Database (HMBD), and differentiates between all metabolites in HMBD, over 70\% of which are indistinguishable from their nearest neighbor using substructure fingerprints.                                                        Conclusion                                MAP4 is a new molecular fingerprint suitable for drugs, biomolecules, and the metabolome and can be adopted as a universal fingerprint to describe and search chemical space. The source code is available at                 https://github.com/reymond-group/map4                 and interactive MAP4 similarity search tools and TMAPs for various databases are accessible at                 http://map-search.gdb.tools/                 and                 http://tm.gdb.tools/map4/                 .},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) is the pathological process caused by the death of the active components of the head of  the femur due to the high dose of hormones, which has become a common public  health problem. BuShenHuoXue capsule (BSHXC) has been clinically proven to be  effective against the SONFH, the main pharmacological action of BSHXC is  tonifying kidney and promoting blood circulation, but the mechanism remains to be  explored. METHODS: We established a rat SONFH model by injecting  Methylprednisolone (MPS) into the right gluteus muscle 30 mg/kg/d, 3 days of  continuous injection every week, 4 weeks in total. According to the clinical  dosage of BSHXC (Herba epimedium 3 g, Eucommia ulmoides 15 g, Salvia  miltiorrhizae 30 g, Chuanxiong 15 g, Paeonia lactiflora Pall 15 g, Poria cocos 12  g, Achyranthes bidentata 12 g, antler gum 10 g, Cyperus rotundus L. Nine g and  Radix Glycyrrhizae 9 g), it was converted into the equivalent dose of rats, and  gavage was performed at the weight of 10 mL/kg, once per day. The BSHXC was  subjected to experiments in vivo, SONFH pharmacodynamics, bioinformatics, and  network of pharmacology to determine the active ingredients, and its protective  role against SONFH, Enrichment analysis was performed to explore the possible  mechanism of BSHXC, and cell experiments were undertaken to analyze the impact of  BSHXC on the hormones associated with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)  between osteogenesis and apoptosis. RESULTS: Experiments confirmed that BSHXC  could effectively reduce bone loss in SONFH rat models. From bioinformatics and a  network constructed from 10 drugs-208 pharmacology-126 targets, the enrichment  analysis showed that the core targets were inflammatory reaction, steroid  hormones, estrogen receptors, osteoporosis, and adjustment of osteogenesis and  osteoclast differentiation, among others. The cell proliferation and staining  supported that the mechanism of BSHXC promoted osteogenesis and intervening in  apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The BSHXC reduced the inflammatory response, changed  steroid response, regulated estrogen receptors, delayed osteoporosis, regulated  osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation by regulating related targets, and  improved the local microenvironment by a multi-component, multi-target, and  multi-link process to delay or reverse the progression of SONFH.},

Previous in silico methods search in structure databases but cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect annotations. Here we introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines in silico structure database generation and annotation with a confidence score consisting of kernel density               P               value estimation and a support vector machine with enforced directionality of features. On diverse datasets, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at low false discovery rates and outperforms spectral library search. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated 12 natural bile acids. The annotation of nine structures was confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. In human samples, we annotated and manually validated 315 molecular structures currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Application of COSMIC to data from 17,400 metabolomics experiments led to 1,715 high-confidence structural annotations that were absent from spectral libraries.},

The results showed that adding ELE had no negative effect on  the growth performance of pigs. Dietary supplements of 0.1\% ELE significantly  increased carcass weight (p {$<$} 0.01), dressing percentage (p {$<$} 0.01), carcass  length (p {$<$} 0.05), and eye muscle area (p {$<$} 0.05). Compared with the control  group, a 0.2\% ELE supplement significantly increased (p {$<$} 0.01) the levels of  adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor 1, and hormone-sensitive lipase and  lipoprotein lipase activity in the serum. Histological examination showed that  ELE inhibited fat deposition in the backfat tissue. Lipid metabolism-related  biochemical indices and mRNA expression levels were improved after supplementing  diets with ELE. Moreover, all three levels of ELE dramatically upregulated (p {$<$}  0.05) the protein levels of p-AMPK-{$\alpha$} and p-ACC. In summary, adding ELE to pig  diets could improve the carcass traits of growing-finishing pigs and exert a  lipid-lowering effect by activating the AMPK-ACC pathway and regulating mRNA  expression levels related to lipid metabolism. Supplementing the diet with  0.1-0.2\% ELE is the optimal range to reduce fat deposition in pig backfat tissue.},

  abstract = {Osteoporosis is one of the most common diseases in the world which resulted in heavy socioeconomic burden and a public health threat. Glucocorticoid-induced  osteoporosis (GIO) is the most common secondary reason of osteoporosis.  Therapeutic strategies using traditional Chinese medicine are under investigation  for osteoporosis, with efforts to improve efficacy and clarify the mechanism. The  combination of Eucommia, Cuscuta, and Drynaria is widely used in traditional  Chinese decoction for osteoporosis treatment, but the experimental efficacy and  mechanism are still unclear. Administration of E.C.D. extracts (Eucommia,  Cuscuta, and Drynaria) in experimental GIO rats resulted in decreased urinal  calcium, phosphorus loss, and decreased expression of RANKL, CTX in serum,  increased serum calcium, phosphorus, and OPG level. E.C.D. extracts also improved  bone density, structural integrity, and biomechanical function in experimental  GIO rats. These finding were associated with E.C.D. extracts' treatment efficacy  to GIO in vivo. The balance between osteoclast and osteoblast activity is  essential for bone remodeling and bone related disease. The E.C.D. extracts  inhibited Raw 264.7 cell differentiation to osteoclast in vitro. On the other  hand, it promoted OPG expression of bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)  which can suppress the osteoclast genesis. E.C.D. extracts also increased the  Wnt1 and Runx2 expression which are related to osteoblast formation. It also  regulated the paracrine effect of MSC to inhibit osteoclast differentiation. The  analysis of HPLC and comprehensive pharmacology identified the constituents of  E.C.D. extracts and the potential osteoporosis-related targets mediated by E.C.D.  extracts. The KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that PI3K/Akt pathway may be  involved in the regulation osteoclast genesis by E.C.D. extracts and the result  of Western blot of vitro assays proved it. Collectively, these data demonstrate  E.C.D. extracts can inhibit osteoclast differentiation to foster experimental  osteoporosis both in vivo and in vitro and it may exert the function of  inhibiting osteoclast differentiation through PI3K/Akt pathway.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overexposure to glucocorticoid (GC) produces various clinical complications, including osteoporosis (OP), dyslipidemia, and  hypercholesterolemia. Geniposide (GEN) is a natural iridoid compound isolated  from Eucommia ulmoides. Our previous study found that GEN could alleviate  dexamethasone (DEX)-induced differentiation inhibition of MC3T3-E1 cells.  However, whether GEN protected against Dex-induced cholesterol accumulation in  osteoblasts was still unclear. METHODS: DEX was used to induce rat OP. Micro-CT  data was obtained. The ALP activity and mineralization were determined by the  staining assays, and the total intracellular cholesterol was determined by the  ELISA kits. The protein expression was detected by western blot. RESULTS: GEN  ameliorated Dex-induced micro-structure damages and cell differentiation  inhibition in the bone trabecula in rats. In MC3T3-E1 cells, Dex enhanced the  total intracellular cholesterol, which reduced the activity of cell proliferation  and differentiation. Effectively, GEN decreased DEX-induced cholesterol  accumulation, enhanced cell differentiation, and upregulated the expression of  the GLP-1R/ABCA1 axis. In addition, inhibition of ABAC1 expression reversed the  actions of GEN. Treatment with Exendin9-39, a GLP-1R inhibitor, could abrogate  the protective activity of GEN. CONCLUSIONS: GEN ameliorated Dex-induced  accumulation of cholesterol and inhibition of cell differentiation by mediating  the GLP-1R/ABCA1 axis in MC3T3-E1 cells.},

The microstructure surface  of various MPU/EUG composites became rough and cracked by the gradual  incorporation of EUG, resulting in a deteriorated compatibility between EUG and  MPU. With the increase of EUG content, the storage modulus (E') of various  MPU/EUG composites increased in a temperature range of -50 \textdegree C to 40 \textdegree C and their  loss factor (tan{$\delta$}) decreased significantly, including a reduction of the tan{$\delta$} of  MPU/EUG (70/30) composites from 0.79 to 0.64. Specifically, the addition of EUG  sharply improved the sound absorption performances of various MPU/EUG composites  in a frequency range of 4.5 kHz-8 kHz. Compared with that of pure MPU, the sound  absorption coefficient of the MPU/EUG (70/30) composite increased 52.2\% at a  pressure of 0.1 MPa and 16.8\% at a pressure of 4 MPa, indicating its outstanding  sound absorption properties.},

The addition of  ELE 1\,h before tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF{$\alpha$}) stimulation inhibited IL-8  production by A549 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The addition of  geniposidic acid, the main component of ELE, also inhibited IL-8 production. To  further investigate the mechanism by which ELE inhibits IL-8 production, the  effect of ELE or geniposidic acid on TNF{$\alpha$}-stimulated p38 phosphorylation was  examined by Western blotting. After 30\,min of TNF{$\alpha$} stimulation, p38  phosphorylation was inhibited by the addition of ELE or geniposidic acid,  suggesting that ELE inhibited IL-8 production in TNF{$\alpha$}-stimulated A549 cells by  suppressing one of the signal transducers of p38 phosphorylation.

The results  indicated there were significant differences between different planting models  for the studied traits, and the traits in the Arbor forest model showed more  abundant variation. Compared with genotype, the planting model accounted for  relatively bigger variance, indicating that the standard should be divided  according to planting models. Furthermore, the optimum planting model for  different traits would be obtained by analyzing the variation range. Association  analyses were conducted among traits to select the crucial evaluation indexes.  The indexes were divided into three grades in different planting models. The  evaluation system on leaf-related traits of EUO germplasm was established  preliminarily, which considered planting models and stability across years for  the first time. It can be treated as a reference to identify and evaluate EUO  germplasm resources.

Total glycosides from Eucommia ulmoides seed (TGEUS) was a  Chinese medicine and have rich pharmacological effects. This study was designed  to explore the mechanism of TGEUS in promoting osteogenic differentiation and  bone formation in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. METHODS: Adipose-derived mesenchymal  stem cells (ADSCs) were isolated and treated with different concentration of  TGEUS. Cell viability was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay.  Osteogenic capacity was identified by ALP staining and ARS staining. Moreover,  RNA sequencing between control and TGEUS treated ADSCs were further performed to  reveal the mechanism of TGEUS in promoting osteogenic differentiation.~The  expression of Jag1, Lfng and Hey1 were measured using quantitative real-time  polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR). Osteogenic markers were further assessed by  western blot. DAPT and NICD were further used to identify whether Notch signaling  pathway involved into TGEUS promoting osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs.  Ovariectomy-induced bone loss rats model was established and divided into three  groups: sham, OVX and OVX\,+\,TGEUS groups. HE staining and immunohistochemical  staining were further performed to identify whether TGEUS could promote bone  formation. RESULTS: TGEUS treatment significantly enhanced the cell viability and  ALP activity than control group, the optimal dose of TGEUS was 5~{$\mu$}M. We selected  5~{$\mu$}M TGEUS for further study. TGEUS significantly enhanced ALP activity and  calcium deposition than that of control group. Activation of Notch signaling  fully blocked TGEUS-induced osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs. Following TGEUS  treatment, the trabecular bone of the rats was significantly increased,  thickened, and more connected compared to the OVX group. With the treatment of  TGEUS, the expression of Osterix (Osx), Osteocalcin (OCN) and RUNX Family  Transcription Factor 2 (RUNX2) increased than OVX group. CONCLUSION: TGEUS  enhanced osteogenic differentiation of ADSCs and promoted bone formation in  ovariectomy-induced bone loss rats. Our study broadened the understanding of  TGEUS as a therapeutic target against osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease dominated by synovial hyperplasia and bone destruction. The male flower of  Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (EF) has been shown to exert effects on the inflammation  caused by RA. However, how EF affects synoviocyte apoptosis and bone destruction  on RA have not been investigated thoroughly. The effects of EF on apoptosis of  human fibroblast-like synoviocytes-rheumatoid arthritis (HFLS-RA) cells,  osteoclast differentiation of RAW264.7 cells, and bone destruction in a  collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model in rats were explored. METHODS: First, the  main components of EF were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography.  In vitro, we investigated the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of EF  on HFLS-RA cells by immunofluorescence assays, flow cytometry, real-time reverse  transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western  blotting; we also investigated how EF influenced the differentiation of RAW264.7  cells into osteoclasts. In vivo, we used a rat model of CIA to investigate the  effects of EF on anti-arthritis activity, toe swelling, Arthritis Score, serum  levels of metabolic bone factors, and pathologic conditions. Micro-computed  tomography was used to scan ankle joints. mRNA and protein expression of factors  related to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) pathway were determined by RT-qPCR  and western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: EF inhibited synoviocyte  proliferation and promoted apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. EF inhibited  osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting activation of the NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway. EF  reduced articular inflammation in CIA rats, inhibited the expression of  pro-angiogenic factors, and delayed the destruction of articular cartilage and  bone. Our data indicated that EF acted via a mechanism related to bone metabolism  induced by the NF-{$\kappa$}B pathway. CONCLUSIONS: EF exerts a potential therapeutic  effect upon RA. Our research will help to elucidate the potential pharmacologic  mechanisms associated with the beneficial effects of EF, and provide an  experimental basis for EF application in clinical treatments.},

The influence of the carbon-carbon cross-linking and ion cross-linking  degree of ER composites on curing, mechanical, thermal, and shape memory  properties were studied by DSC, DMA, and other analytical techniques. Dicumyl  peroxide (DCP) and zinc dimethacrylate (ZDMA) played a key role in preparing ER  composites with a double cross-linking structure, where DCP initiated  polymerization of ZDMA, and grafted ZDMA onto polymer molecular chains and  cross-linked rubber molecular chains. Meanwhile, ZDMA combined with rubber  macromolecules to build ionic cross-linking bonds in composites under the action  of DCP and reinforced the ER composites. The result showed that the coexistence  of these two cross-linking networks provide a sufficient restoring force for  deformation of shape memory composites. The addition of ZDMA not only improved  the mechanical properties of materials, but also significantly enhanced shape  memory performance of composites. In particular, Eucommia rubber composites  exhibited outstanding mechanical properties and shape memory performance when DCP  content was 0.2 phr.},

  abstract = {A biological pretreatment of Eucommia ulmoides leaf biomass was carried out. Above all, the total flavonoids were isolated from Eucommia ulmoides leaves by  the treatment of alkaline solution of sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate combined  with ultrasonic microwave. The extraction parameters were optimized by central  composite design (CCD) software and were displayed as follows: surfactant  concentration of 1.5\%, microwave power of 700 W, extraction time of 30 min, and  liquid-solid ratio of 50 mL/g. The actual yield of total flavonoids was 1.45\%.  The results of Sudan III color development showed that the cuticle of Eucommia  ulmoides leaves was completely removed after dilute alkali pretreatment. Then,  Eucommia ulmoides leaves were fermented by Trichoderma viride to remove the  holocellulose and obtain gutta-percha. The content of cellulose and hemicellulose  in Eucommia ulmoides leaves obviously decreased after Trichoderma viride  fermentation. The optimum parameters were listed as follows: solid-liquid ratio  of 0.06 g/mL, four extraction times, extraction time of 89.72 min, and extraction  temperature of 85 \textdegree C. The actual yield of gutta-percha was 4.38\%. The amount of  extraction solvent per unit weight of gutta-percha from untreated Eucommia  ulmoides leaves was 2.91 mL/mg, while that from leaves treated by Trichoderma  viride was only 0.96 mL/mg. The amount of extraction solvent was grossly reduced,  which is beneficial in terms of environmental protection. The characterizations  of gutta-percha were verified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR),  X-ray diffraction (XRD), and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H NMR). This  study laid a certain theoretical and experimental basis for the multi-stage  extraction of Eucommia ulmoides leaves and the utilization of Eucommia ulmoides  resources.},

Autophagy can resist  apoptosis and AMPK plays an important role in autophagy regulation. Aucubin from  the small tree Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., which has a long history of use in  orthopaedics and traumatology in Asian medicine, can promote bone formation, but  whether it can slow or prevent steroid-osteoblast apoptosis is unclear.  Therefore, we investigated the pathogenesis of SONFH and how the osteoblast  responds to aucubin under the dexamethasone stimulation. In human femoral head  osteonecrosis specimens, we found that the autophage and apoptosis level were  increased, and the AMPK signalling was crucial to autophagy. We observed that  aucubin could prevent dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in osteoblasts by enhancing  the level of autophagy. Further, we confirmed that the regulatory effect of  aucubin on autophagy and apoptosis was achieved by activating AMPK signalling. We  have demonstrated a mechanism of disease progression and shown that aucubin could  enhance autophagy through AMPK signalling to prevent osteoblast apoptosis. These  findings provide a basis for the further investigation of the potential  therapeutic role of aucubin in the SONFH.},

Its dried bark has a long history of use as a traditional medicinal  material in East Asia, which led to many glycosides, such as aucubin, geniposide,  hyperoside, astragalin, and pinoresinol diglucoside, being recognized as  pharmacologically active ingredients. Uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases  (UGTs) catalyze a glycosyl-transferring reaction from the donor molecule  uridine-5'-diphosphate-glucose (UDPG) to the substrate, which plays an important  role in many biological processes, such as plant growth and development,  secondary metabolism, and environmental adaptation. In order to explore the  biosynthetic pathways of glycosides in E. ulmoides, 91 putative EuUGT genes were  identified throughout the complete genome of E. ulmoides through function  annotation and an UDPGT domain search. Phylogenetic analysis categorized them  into 14 groups. We also performed GO annotations on all the EuUGTs to gain  insights into their functions in E. ulmoides. In addition, transcriptomic  analysis indicated that most EuUGTs showed different expression patterns across  diverse organs and various growing seasons. By protein-protein interaction  predication, a biosynthetic routine of flavonoids and their glycosides was also  proposed. Undoubtedly, these results will help in future research into the  biosynthetic pathways of glycoside compounds in E. ulmoides.},

In the current  study, 13 anti-neuroinflammatory compounds were isolated from Eucommia ulmoides  Oliv. leaves. Among these compounds, trans-sinapaldehyde (6),  3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxy-3-methylflavone (7), and amarusine A (13) were isolated  from E. ulmoides leaves for the first time. The ursane-type C(29)-triterpenoid,  ulmoidol (ULM, 9), significantly inhibited the production of proinflammatory  mediators and reduced the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)  and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Moreover, ULM inhibited the cluster of  differentiation 14 (CD14)/Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway and  consequently limited the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) and  mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Notably,  electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and molecular docking analyses  indicated that ULM could prevent PU box binding-1 (PU.1) from binding to DNA,  suggesting that PU.1 might be a potential ULM target. In conclusion, ULM  alleviates neuroinflammatory responses in microglia, which could be partly  explained by its targeting of PU.1 and the resulting suppression of the  TLR4/MAPK/NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling pathways. These results suggested that ULM may have  therapeutic potential as an agent for treating neuroinflammation-related  neurodegenerative diseases.},

The intestinal microbiota-bile acid axis  plays important roles in the occurrence and recovery of inflammatory bowel  disease (IBD). However, whether EL extract (ELE) has regulatory effects on the  intestinal microbiota, bile acid metabolism, and IBD is still unclear. To fill  this gap, 2\% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mild IBD in a C57BL/6J mouse  model that was treated with 200 or 400 mg/kg (intake dose/body weight) ELE was  used. Oral ELE supplementation alleviated DSS-induced shortening of colon and  colonic epithelial injury. Compared with the DSS group, ELE supplementation  significantly decreased Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and interlukin-6 (IL-6) and  increased occludin and claudin-1 mRNA expression level in the colon (p {$<$} 0.05).  Combined 16S rRNA gene sequencing and targeted metabolomic analyses demonstrated  that ELE significantly improved the diversity and richness of the intestinal  microbiota, decreased the abundance of Bacteroidaceae, and increased  Akkermansiaceae and Ruminococcaceae abundance (p {$<$} 0.05) compared with  DSS-induced IBD mice. Moreover, ELE significantly increased the serum contents of  deoxycholic acid (DCA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), which were highly  positively correlated with Akkermansia and unidentified\_Ruminococccaceae relative  to the DSS group. We then found that ELE increased Takeda G-protein coupled  receptor 5 (TGR5), claudin-1, and occludin mRNA expression levels in the colon.  In the Caco-2 cell model, we confirmed that activation of TGR5 improved the  reduction in transepithelial electoral resistance (TEER) and decreased the  permeability of FITC-dextran on monolayer cells induced by LPS (p {$<$} 0.05). siRNA  interference assays showed that the decrease in TGR5 expression led to the  decrease in TEER, an increase in FITC-dextran permeability, and a decrease in  claudin-1 protein expression in Caco-2 cells. In summary, ELE alleviated IBD by  influencing the intestinal microbiota structure and composition of bile acids,  which in turn activated the colonic TGR5 gene expression in the colon and  promoted the expression of tight junction proteins. These findings provide new  insight for using ELE as a functional food with adjuvant therapeutic effects in  IBD.},

The results of this screening showed significant and  reproducible inhibition of glucose uptake between 40 and 80\% by methanolic  extracts made from the fruits of Aronia melanocarpa, Cornus officinalis,  Crataegus pinnatifida, Lycium chinense, and Vaccinium myrtillus; the leaves of  Brassica oleracea, Juglans regia, and Peumus boldus; and the roots of Adenophora  triphylla. Furthermore, glucose uptake was inhibited between 50 and 70\% by  aqueous extracts made from the bark of Eucommia ulmoides and the fruit skin of  Malus domestica. The methanolic extracts of Juglans regia and Peumus boldus  inhibited the fructose transport between 30 and 40\% in Caco2 cells as well.

  abstract = {Here, we investigated the protective efficacy of protocatechuic acid (PCA) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic lung injury. Eighty-two male  Balb/c mice were divided into six groups: control, PCA30 (30~mg/kg), LPS  (10~mg/kg), PCA10-LPS, PCA20-LPS, and PCA30-LPS treated with 10, 20 and 30~mg/kg  PCA, respectively, for seven days before intraperitoneal LPS injection. PCA  pre-treatment, especially at higher dose, significantly reduced LPS-induced lung  tissue injury as indicated by increased heat shock protein 70 and antioxidant  molecules (reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione  peroxidase, and glutathione reductase) accompanied by lower oxidative stress  indices (malondialdehyde and nitric oxide). PCA administration decreased  inflammatory mediators including myeloperoxidase, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B  p65), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and prevented the development of apoptotic  events in the lung tissue. At the molecular level, PCA downregulated mRNA  expression of nitric oxide synthase 2, C/EBP homologous protein, and high  mobility group box1 in the lungs of all PCA-LPS treated mice. Thus,  PCA-pre-treatment effectively counteracted sepsis-induced acute lung injury in  vivo by promoting and antioxidant status, while inhibiting inflammation and  apoptosis. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Sepsis-mediated organ dysfunction and high  mortality is aggravated by acute lung injury (ALI). Therefore, new therapeutic  approaches are needed to encounter sepsis-mediated ALI. Protocatechuic acid (PCA)  is a naturally occurring phenolic acid with various biological and  pharmacological activities. PCA is abundant in edible plants including Allium  cepa L., Oryza sativa L., Hibiscus sabdariffa, Prunus domestica~L., and Eucommia  ulmoides. In this investigation we studied the potential protective role of pure  PCA (10, 20 and 30~mg/kg) on LPS-mediated septic lung injury in mice through  examining oxidative challenge, inflammatory response, apoptotic events and  histopathological changes in addition to evaluating the levels and mRNA  expression of heat shock protein 70, C/EBP homologous protein and high mobility  group box1 in the lung tissue. The recorded results showed that PCA  pre-administration was able to significantly abrogate the damages in the lung  tissue associated septic response. This protective effect comes from its strong  antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic activities, suggesting that  PCA may be applied to alleviate ALI associated with the development of sepsis.},

Since neurons lack a cystine transport system, neuronal GSH synthesis  depends on cystine uptake via the cystine/glutamate exchange transporter (xCT),  GSH synthesis, and release in/from surrounding astrocytes. Transcription factor  nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a detoxifying master  transcription factor, is expressed mainly in astrocytes and activates the gene  expression of various phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes or antioxidants  including GSH-related molecules and metallothionein by binding to the antioxidant  response element (ARE) of these genes. Accumulating evidence has shown the  involvement of dysfunction of antioxidative molecules including GSH and its  related molecules in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) or parkinsonian  models. Furthermore, we found several agents targeting GSH synthesis in the  astrocytes that protect nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD models.

  abstract = {Pinoresinol (PINL) and pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG), two natural lignans found in Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (Duzhong), have several pharmacological activities.  However, there is no report available on their absorption, distribution,  metabolism, and elimination (ADME) properties. Given the possible wide spectrum  of their application in therapeutic areas, this area should be investigated. This  work studied the in vitro ADME properties of PDG and PINL, including their  kinetic solubility, permeability across monolayer cells (PAMPA), protein binding,  and metabolic stabilities in liver microsomes. The in vivo pharmacokinetic study  and in vitro vasorelaxant effects on isolated phenylephrine-induced aortic rings  of PINL and PDG were also investigated. It was found that both of their kinetic  solubility in PBS (pH 7.4) was greater than 100~{$\mu$}M, indicating that they are both  soluble compounds. The permeability investigations (P (eff) ) by PAMPA indicated  that PINL had higher permeability than PDG (p {$<$} 0.05). Both components  represented moderate plasma protein binding activities (average binding rate in  human plasma: PINL 89.03\%, PDG 45.21\%) and low metabolic rate (t (1/2) in human  liver microsome: PINL 1509.5~min, PDG 1004.8~min). Furthermore, the results of  pharmacokinetic studies indicated that PINL might be eliminated less quickly than  PDG from the rat plasma, and its cumulative urinary excretion was much lower than  that of PDG. The phenylephrine-induced aortic rings demonstrated  concentration-dependent vasorelaxation in PDG, PINL, or their combination group.  The vasorelaxant effects of PINL were more obvious than those of PDG, whereas the  vasorelaxant effect of the combinations was significantly better than that of the  single component (p {$<$} 0.05). The similarity or difference between PINL and its  diglucoside in these pharmaceutical aspects may offer valuable insights into the  further exploration of lignans and might contribute to relevant studies involving  natural products with similar molecular structure and their glucosides.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eucommia ulmoides seed oil is a functional health oil with a high content of unsaturated fatty acids. However, excessively high content of  unsaturated fatty acids can cause E. ulmoides seed oil to easily spoil.  Microencapsulation technology can effectively encapsulate substances, thereby  prolonging the spoilage time of oil products. METHODS: In the present study, E.  ulmoides seed oil from different manufacturers were analyzed by Agilent  7890B-5977A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Encapsulation efficiency, yield  rate, and scanning electron microscopy results between microcapsules prepared use  different wall materials and different methods (spray drying and complex  coagulation) were compared to determine the best preparation process for  microcapsules. The Wantong 892 professional oil oxidation stability tester was  used to measure the induced oxidation time of the E. ulmoides seed oil and  microcapsules. CONCLUSION: E. ulmoides seed oil comprises\,{$>$}\,80\% unsaturated fatty  acids with a high {$\alpha$}-linolenic acid content, followed by linoleic acid. The most  promising combination was chitosan:gum arabic at 1:8 as the wall material and  complex coagulation. The best preparation had a wall material concentration,  stirring speed, aggregation pH, and core-to-wall ratio of 2.5\%, 500~rpm, 4.2, and  1:4, respectively. Microcapsules prepared under these conditions exhibited higher  yield and encapsulation efficiency (94.0\% and 73.3\%, respectively). The induced  oxidation time of the E. ulmoides seed oil and microcapsules were 3.8~h and  13.9~h, respectively, indicating that microencapsulation can increase the  oxidation induction time of this oil.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: Eucommia ulmoides polysaccharides (EUP) can regulate the immunity of macrophages, but the functional status of macrophages is related to  osteoarthritis and synovial inflammation. The purpose of this study is to explore  whether EUP has the effect of inhibiting osteoarthritis and its possible  mechanism. Methods: MTT test was used to evaluate the appropriate concentration  of EUP and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was  conducted to detect the effect of EUP on gene expression in RAW 264.7 cells. The  osteoarthritis model was constructed by the anterior cruciate ligament  transection (ACLT) in the rabbits. These rabbits were divided into three groups,  sham operation group, OA group, and EUP group. The changes in articular cartilage  were detected by gross observation and histological staining, and Micro-CT tested  subchondral bone. Finally, the changes of macrophages in synovial tissue were  studied by immunohistochemistry. Results: The results showed that EUP at the  concentration of 50ug/mL and 100ug/mL were beneficial to the proliferation of  macrophages. The qPCR results indicated that EUP inhibited the expression of  inflammation-related genes IL-6, IL-18 and IL-1{$\beta$}, and promoted the expression of  osteogenic and cartilage-related genes BMP-6, Arg-1 and transforming growth  factor beta (TGF-{$\beta$}). The results of in vivo experiments suggested that the degree  of destruction of articular cartilage in the EUP group was significantly reduced,  and the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score was  significantly reduced. Compared with the OA group, the subchondral cancellous  bone density of the EUP group increased, the number and thickness of trabecular  bone increased, and the separation of trabecular bone decreased. Synovial  macrophage immunohistochemistry results manifested that EUP, on the one hand,  reduced M1 polarized macrophages, on the other hand, accumulated M2 polarized  macrophages. Conclusion: EUP can promote articular cartilage repair and  subchondral bone reconstruction. The regulation of the polarization state of  macrophages may be one of its mechanisms to delay the progression of  osteoarthritis.},

Different compositions of herbal extract mixture (HEM) have  various components and diverse functions. This study aimed to evaluate the  effects of HEM (Lonicera japonica, Astragalus membranaceus, Eucommia folium, and  Codonopsis pilosula) on intestinal antioxidant capacity and colonic microbiota in  weaned pigs. A total of 18 piglets [Duroc \texttimes{} (Landrace \texttimes{} Yorkshire)] with the  initial body weight of 5.99 {$\pm$} 0.13 kg (weaned at 21 days) were randomly divided  into two groups (n = 9): the control group (CON, basal diet) and the HEM  treatment group (HEM, 1,000 mg/kg HEM + basal diet). The experiment period lasted  for 14 days. Our results showed that dietary supplementation with HEM modulated  the antioxidant capacity through decreasing the activity of superoxide dismutase  (SOD) in the ileum and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in the serum, and  decreasing the mRNA expression of Kelch like-ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) in  the jejunum and the protein level of Keap1 in the ileum. Moreover, the HEM group  modified the composition of colonic microbiota with affecting relative abundances  of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes at the phylum level. Taken together,  supplementation of HEM can regulate the antioxidant capacity and modify the  composition of colonic bacteria in weaning piglets. This study provides new  insights into the combination effects of herbal extracts on weaning piglets.},

  abstract = {The core microbiome, as a unique group of microorganisms, is an emerging research hotspot that provides a new opportunity to improve growth and production of a  host. However, the subjectivity associated with the concept of "core microbiome"  means there is currently no uniform definition method for the core microbiome. In  this study, the strengths and limitations of four commonly used definition  methods for the core microbiome were explored from composition to function based  on the 16S rRNA gene dataset of Eucommia ulmoides bark from 25 different  biogeographical regions in China. There were differences in the composition of  the core microbiomes defined by the different methods. The four definition  methods of phylogeny, membership, composition, and network connection contained  274, 10, 5, and 5 core OTUs (operational taxonomic units), respectively. In  contrast, the core microbiomes defined by different methods displayed  similarities in function. In addition, different definition methods showed  varying preferences for abundant taxa, intermediate taxa, and rare taxa. Some  core taxa defined by the definition method of phylogeny were significantly  associated with pharmacologically active ingredients of E. ulmoides bark. The  findings of this study suggest that although the core microbiomes defined by  different methods have preferences in composition and function, the term refers  to a group of microbes that are particularly notable and important for  host-associated microbiomes. Therefore, we propose: (I) The definition method of  the core microbiome should be selected according to the ecological problems  faced; (II) A combination of multiple methods may comprehensively reveal the core  microbiome at different levels of the host, and may also facilitate understanding  of the ecological and evolutionary processes that govern host-microbe  interactions.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Eucommia ulmoides leaves are used as Tochu tea, which has a blood pressure lowering effect of unknown mechanism. PURPOSE AND METHODS: The effects  of Tochu tea and its component, geniposidic acid, on blood pressure and renal  hemodynamics were investigated in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats received 1\%  saline solution from 4 weeks of age. At 9 weeks of age, 1\% saline alone (DSHS),  Tochu tea extract added 1\% saline (DSHS+T), or geniposidic acid added 1\% saline  (DSHS+G) was administered for another 4 weeks. DS rats fed with tap water were  used as controls (DSLS). At 13 weeks, the blood pressure, the renal plasma flow  (RPF) and the renal NADPH oxidase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were  examined. RESULTS: Blood pressure in DSHS rats was significantly increased in  comparison to DSLS (144 vs. 196~mmHg, p~{$<~$}0.01), and was significantly reduced in  DSHS+T (158~mmHg) and DSHS+G (162~mmHg) rats. RPF in DSHS+T rats was  significantly higher than in DSHS rats (p~{$<~$}0.05). The expression of NADPH  oxidase in DSHS rats was enhanced in comparison to DSLS rats; however, it was  suppressed in DSHS+T and DSHS+G rats, and the NO production by eNOS was  increased; thus, RPF was improved. The urinary Na excretion in DSHS rats was  higher than that in DSLS rats; however it was further increased in DSHS+T rats  without changes in the tubular Na transporters. CONCLUSION: Tochu tea and  geniposidic acid suppressed NADPH oxidase, increased eNOS, and improved blood  pressure and renal hemodynamics.},

  abstract = {Eucommia leaves are dry leaves of Eucommia ulmoides which have long been considered as a functional health food for the treatment of hypertension,  hypercholesterolemia, fatty liver, and osteoporosis. With the recent development  of Chinese medicine, Eucommia leaves are widely used for tonifying the kidneys  and strengthening bone. However, the specific molecular mechanism of Eucommia  leaves for strengthening bone remains largely unknown. Osteoblasts are the main  functional cells of bone formation; thus, it is essential to study the effect of  Eucommia leaves on osteoblasts to better understand their mechanism of action. In  the present study, we prepared an aqueous extract of Eucommia leaves (ELAE) and  determined its content by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The  effects of ELAE on MC3T3-E1 cells were investigated by CCK-8 assay, alkaline  phosphatase (ALP), and Alizarin red S staining assays, combined with RNA  sequencing (RNA-seq) and qRT-PCR validation. We demonstrated that ELAE had a  significant promoting effect on the proliferation of MC3T3-E1 cells and  significantly enhanced extracellular matrix synthesis and mineralization, which  were achieved by regulating various functional genes and related signaling  pathways. ELAE significantly increased the expression level of genes promoting  cell proliferation, such as Rpl10a, Adnp, Pex1, Inpp4a, Frat2, and Pcdhga1, and  reduced the expression level of genes inhibiting cell proliferation, such as  Npm1, Eif3e, Cbx3, Psmc6, Fgf7, Fxr1, Ddx3x, Mbnl1, and Cdc27. In addition, ELAE  increased the expression level of gene markers in osteoblasts, such as Col5a2,  Ubap2l, Dkk3, Foxm1, Col16a1, Col12a1, Usp7, Col4a6, Runx2, Sox4, and Bmp4. Taken  together, our results suggest that ELAE could promote osteoblast proliferation,  differentiation, and mineralization and prevent osteoblast apoptosis. These  findings not only increase our understanding of ELAE on the regulation of bone  development but also provide a possible strategy to further study the prevention  and treatment of osteogenic related diseases by ELAE.},

  abstract = {Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common complication in patients with diabetes and a leading cause of mortality. The management of DN in the clinic still remains a  challenge. Therefore, the identification of novel compounds for DN treatment and  their characterization in preclinical DN models are crucial. Isoeucommin A is a  lignan compound isolated from Eucommia~ulmoides Oliv, which has not been studied  in detail. Our aim was to investigate the effect of Isoeucommin A in DN and to  elucidate the molecular mechanisms though which Isoeucommin A acts in~vitro and  in~vivo. We first isolated and purified Isoeucommin A by microporous resin column  chromatography and studied the mass spectrogram, as well as the structure of  Isoeucommin A, by high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy and  NMR, respectively. We further established an in~vivo rat DN model and measured  the changes of blood glucose, body weight, kidney index (KI), blood urea  nitrogen, creatinine (CRE), glutathione, malondialdehyde (MDA), SOD, albumin  (ALB) and urinary ALB to CRE ratios on treatment with Isoeucommin A. In addition,  we measured SOD, MDA, glycogen synthase kinase-3{$\beta$} (GSK-3{$\beta$}), phosphorylated  (p)-GSK-3{$\beta$}, nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme  oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot, and  estimated cell viability by a  3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay. After  Isoeucommin A treatment, body weight, as well as SOD, glutathione, HO-1 and Nrf2  expression levels, in DN rats increased in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast,  the levels of blood glucose, KI, blood urea nitrogen, CRE, urinary ALB to CRE  ratio, tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}, interleukin-1{$\beta$}, interleukin-6 and MDA decreased  significantly. In addition, Isoeucommin A protected H(2) O(2) -stimulated renal  tubular epithelial cells from oxidative stress and activated the Nrf2/HO-1  signaling pathway in high-glucose-stimulated human renal mesangial cells. In  conclusion, Isoeucommin A could alleviate inflammation and oxidative stress in  in~vitro and in~vivo DN models and thus attenuate kidney injury by activating the  Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. Isoeucommin A could have the potential to be used as  an effective drug for the treatment of DN.},

Two new  alkaloids, named asperflaloids A and B (1 and 2), together with 10 known  compounds (3-12) were obtained from the EtOAc extract of the strain.  Interestingly, the alkaloids 1-4 with different frameworks are characterized by  the presence of the same anthranilic acid residue. The structures were  established by detailed analyses of the spectroscopic data. The absolute  configuration of asperflaloids A and B was resolved by quantum chemistry  calculation. All compounds were screened for their inhibitions against  {$\alpha$}-glucosidase and the antioxidant capacities. The results were that compound 3  had an IC(50) value of 750.8 {$\mu$}M toward {$\alpha$}-glucosidase, and the phenol compounds 7  and 8 exhibited potent antioxidant capacities with IC(50) values 14.4 and 27.1 {$\mu$}M  respectively.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ischemic stroke (IS) is a serious disease with a high rate of death and disability, and a growing number of people are becoming victims. Existing  drugs not only have limited therapeutic effects but also have obvious side  effects. Most importantly, drug resistance due to long-term or improper use of  drugs is detrimental to patients. Therefore, it is urgent to find some  alternative or supplementary medicines to alleviate the current embarrassment.  Powerful Tianma Eucommia Capsule (PTEC) is mainly used to treat IS in China for  thousands of years; however, the molecular mechanism is not clear. METHODS:  Pharmacology ingredients and target genes were filtered and downloaded from  websites. A pharmacology ingredient-target gene network was constructed to  predict the molecular interactions between ingredients and target genes.  Enrichment analysis was performed to explore the possible signal pathways. LeDock  was used to simulate the interaction form between proteins and main active  ingredients and to deduce key amino acid positions. RESULTS: Two hundred  eighty-nine target genes and seventy-four pharmacological ingredients were  obtained from public databases. Several key ingredients (quercetin, kaempferol,  and stigmasterol) and primary core target genes (PTGS1, NCOA2, and PRSS1) were  detected through ingredient-target gene network analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis demonstrated  that ingredients affect networks mainly in nuclear receptor activity and G  protein-coupled amine receptor activity; besides, fluid shear stress and  atherosclerosis, human cytomegalovirus infection, and hepatitis B signaling  pathways might be the principal therapy ways. A series of presumed key amino acid  sites (189ASP, 190SER, 192GLN, 57HIS, and 99TYE) were calculated in PRSS1. Six of  the target genes were differentially expressed between male and female patients.  CONCLUSIONS: Seven new putative target genes (ACHE, ADRA1A, AR, CHRM3, F7,  GABRA1, and PRSS1) were observed in this work. Based on the result of GO and KEGG  analysis, this work will be helpful to further demonstrate the molecular  mechanism of PTEC treatment of IS.},

These bioactive  chemicals improve immune function and regulate lipid metabolism. The aim of this  study was to investigate the effects of EUL on the biochemical properties of  milk. Twenty Holstein dairy cows were randomly allocated to two groups fed a  control (CTR, diet without EUL, n = 10) or EUL (diet containing 3\% EUL, dry  matter, n = 10) diet for 55 d. At the end of the experimental period (d 55), milk  samples were collected and analyzed to determine their composition. Though levels  of milk fat, protein, lactose, and total milk solids were similar between the  groups, small molecules, metabolites, lipids, and cytokines differed. Compared  with the CTR group, the EUL group had an improved cluster of differentiation  (CD)4/CD8 ratio (P {$<$} 0.05) and lower interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-6 content (P {$<$}  0.05). Metabolomics analysis identified 14 metabolites including 7Z, 10Z, 13Z,  16Z, 19Z-docosapentaenoic acid (FC = 3.129), adrenic acid (FC = 2.830), and  eicosapentaenoic acid (FC=1.685) as having significantly increased in the EUL  group (P {$<$} 0.05) while 11 metabolites, including indole-2-carboxylic acid (FC =  0.636), cholic acid (FC = 0.430), and creatine (FC = 0.784) had significantly  decreased (P {$<$} 0.05). Based on a constructed metabolome map, linoleic acid  metabolism had the highest impact value for EUL. A total of 21 lipid classes and  1,094 lipid species were detected in the milk by lipidomic analysis, among which  40 differed significantly between the CTR and EUL groups. The present findings  showed that the EUL altered milk composition. Correlation analysis showed that  7Z, 10Z, 13Z, 16Z, 19Z-docosapentaenoic acid, adrenic acid, and eicosapentaenoic  acid levels were negatively correlated with those of the inflammatory factors  IL-6 and IL-8 (P {$<$} 0.05), indicating that EUL improved milk quality by reducing  inflammatory factors and increasing the CD4/CD8 ratio. Overall, our data  demonstrate that EUL had positive effects on milk antioxidant parameters, immune  indices, and micro-composition metabolism, thereby improving milk quality.},

METHODS: Sixty 8-week-old C57BL/6J ApoE  knockout mice were fed a high-fat for 12 weeks and randomly divided into four  treatment groups (n = 15 each): high-fat control, bortezomib (a proteasome  inhibitor), bortezomib combined with Qingre Huayu Fang, and Qingre Huayu Fang  alone. Aortic sections were examined for plaque development, inflammatory cell  infiltration, type I/III collagen expression and immunohistochemical staining of  CD40L, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-{$\kappa$}B)/P65 and ubiquitin. RESULTS: Mice in the  high-fat control group had obvious atherosclerosis, with increased aortic plaque  area. The degree of atherosclerosis of the atherosclerotic plaque was reduced in  all of the treatment groups that received bortezomib and/or Duzhong (Cortex  Eucommiae) Qingre Huayu. The expression of NF-?B, CD40L and ubiquitin were all  reduced in the group that received combination bortezomib + Qingre Huayu Fang.  CONCLUSION: The Qingre Huayu Fang inhibited aortic atherosclerosis in mice  through a mechanism that may involve inhibition of the ubiquitin proteasome  pathway.},

The group II was further divided  into five subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis, and each clade was well  supported by the conserved motifs. All the genes were located on 34 different  scaffolds respectively. A number of development-, light-, hormone-, and  stress-related elements were randomly distributed in the promoter sequences of  EuWRKYs. Expression profiles indicated that EuWRKY genes were involved in leaf  development, and majority of EuWRKYs genes were highly expressed in leaf buds.  Co-expression analysis of WRKYs suggested an intricate interplay of  growth-related responses. EuWRKY4 was involved in a complex proteins interaction  network. Collectively, our results provide extensive insights into the WRKY gene  family, thereby contributing to the screening of additional candidate genes in E.  ulmoides.},

In the  present study, extracts of E. ulmoides leaves were found to display potential  renal protective properties in rat glomerular mesangial (HBZY-1) cells treated  with high levels of glucose, suggesting that they possess potential factors  capable of treating diabetic nephropathy. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography  tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) was used to  comprehensively characterize the chemical components of E. ulmoides leaves. A  total of 83 possible chemical components, including 12 iridoids, 13 flavonoids,  14 lignans, 20 phenylpropanoids, 14 phenolic acids, and 10 additional components,  were identified in E. ulmoides leaves. Network pharmacology was used for a  preliminary exploration of the potential mechanism of action of renal protection  afforded by E. ulmoides leaves towards diabetic nephropathy. The network  pharmacology results were verified using a series of biological experiments. The  present study provided the basis for the comprehensive development and  utilization of E. ulmoides leaves and the discovery of potential drugs.},

Eucommia ulmoides is one of the traditional  Chinese medicine herbs, which has been used to recover functions of the kidney.  However, its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the  effects and protective mechanism of Eucommia ulmoides extract on renal injury  caused by long-term high purine diets in rats. SD rats underwent an intragastric  adenine (200 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) administration for 9 weeks and were treated for 15  weeks. The results demonstrated that Eucommia ulmoides extract significantly  reduced serum Cre and BUN levels in rats. H\&E and Masson's trichrome stains  showed notable lowering of the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the formation  of fibrous tissues and collagen fibers, and improvement in the pathological  morphology of kidneys. It also suppressed the protein and mRNA expressions of  TGF-{$\beta$}1 and {$\alpha$}-SMA and enhanced E-cadherin expression. Meanwhile, Eucommia ulmoides  extract prominently inhibited the mRNA expression of Col I, Col III, Col IV,  TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 and promoted expressions of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Through  our study, it is the first time to prove that Eucommia ulmoides extract could  ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis and may involve in the regulation of the  extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation enzyme (MMPs/TIMPs) system, promotion of  the expression of E-cadherin, and suppression of expressions of TGF-{$\beta$}1 and {$\alpha$}-SMA.

Early prevention and treatment of renal injury in patients with  hypertension is great significance. The study, which used an integrated  ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS)  analysis, network pharmacology approach, and plasma metabolomics, aimed to  discover the active ingredients and therapeutic mechanisms of Eucommiae folium  (Ef) in treating Hki. The chemical components of Ef were analyzed by  UPLC-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS), and the  "compound-target-disease" network was constructed by screening the closely  related drug targets from the drug-target database, then the signaling pathways  related to Hki were analyzed. Finally, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay  (ELISA) and real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain  reaction were used to test and verify the key targets in the common pathways of  metabolomics and network pharmacology. The results indicated that Eucommiae  folium might play an excellent role in treating Hki, likely through regulating  the vascular endothelial growth factor signaling pathway, hypoxia inducible  factor 1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway, and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway,  which were validated by increasing levels of nitric oxide, endothelial nitric  oxide synthase and reducing levels of endothelin 1, angiotensin II, renin, cyclic  guanosine monophosphate, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine, as well as  the reduced gene expression of Ache, Ddah2, Egfr, Lcat, Pla2g2a, Stat3 and Vegfa.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: When redox balance is lost in the brain, oxidative stress can cause serious damage that leads to neuronal loss, in congruence with neurodegenerative  diseases. Aucubin (AU) is an iridoid glycoside and that is one of the active  constituents of Eucommia ulmoides, has many pharmacological effects such as  anti-inflammation, anti-liver fibrosis, and anti-atherosclerosis. PURPOSE: The  present study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of AU on cell oxidative  stress against hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced injury in SH-SY5Y cells in  vitro. METHODS: SH-SY5Y cells were simultaneously treated with AU and H(2)O(2)  for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8. Additionally, mitochondrial  membrane depolarization, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and cell  apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The results showed that AU  can significantly increase the H(2)O(2)-induced cell viability and the  mitochondrial membrane potential, decrease the ROS generation, malondialdehyde  (MDA), and increase glutathione (GSH) contents and the superoxide dismutase (SOD)  activity. We also found that H(2)O(2) stimulated the production of nitric oxide  (NO), which could be reduced by treatment with AU through inhibiting the  inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression. In H(2)O(2)-induced  SH-SY5Y cells, the levels of tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}), interleukin-6  (IL-6) and interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}) content and cell apoptosis were significantly  reduced by AU treatment through nuclear factor E2-related factor 2/hemo  oxygenase-1 (Nrf2/HO-1) activation, inhibiting the expression of p-NF-{$\kappa$}B/NF-{$\kappa$}B  and down-regulating MAPK and Bcl-2/Bax pathways. CONCLUSION: These results  indicate that AU can reduce inflammation and oxidative stress through the NF-{$\kappa$}B,  Nrf2/HO-1, and MAPK pathways.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a type of polyphenolic substance that is widely extracted from many traditional Chinese medicines (eg, Lonicera japonica  Thunb, Eucommia ulmoides Oliver) and exhibits a wide range of anti-tumor effects.  However, the potential molecular mechanisms of CGA in glioma U373 cells remain  unclear. METHODS: Network pharmacology analysis was used to explore the potential  therapeutic targets of CGA in glioma. Human glioma U373 cells were treated with  different concentrations of CGA for 24 h. CCK-8 assays were used to detect the  inhibitory rate of cell growth. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and Hoechst 33342  staining were used to detect apoptosis. PI staining was used to investigate  cell-cycle progression. Wound healing assays and transwell assays were used to  detect the cell migration and invasion, respectively. Western blotting and  immunohistochemistry were used to measure protein levels in vitro and in vivo.  RESULTS: The proliferation of U373 cells was significantly inhibited by CGA in a  dose- and time-dependent manner. CGA significantly arrested the cell cycle of  U373 cells in the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis. Moreover, CGA significantly  suppressed the migration and invasion of U373 cells. Additionally, we found that  CGA inhibited the growth of U373 cells in vivo. Furthermore, network pharmacology  analysis suggested that the anti-tumor effects of CGA on U373 cells were  associated with the down-regulation of the SRC/MAPKs signaling pathway.  DISCUSSION: The present study indicated that CGA had anti-glioma effects on U373  cells by down-regulating SRC/MAPKs signal pathway.},

  abstract = {Sichuan province is very famous for its abundant resources of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM).However, within the scope of administrative division of Sichuan  province, the origin records of Dao-di herbs in different historical periods show  a dynamic distribution process. On the basis of carefully sorting out the  geographical scope of Sichuan province in different historical periods, this  article focuses on the textual research of the Dao-di herbs in Sichuan province  recorded in the seven mainstream ancient works of materia medica.The results  showed that, according to the records of Mingyi bielu and Bencaojing Jizhu, the  main distribution areas of Dao-di herbs were mainly in the central and eastern  regions of Sichuan province, mainly including Moschus, Coptidis Rhizoma,  Zingiberis Rhizoma, Aconiti Lateralis Radix Praeparata and most of the rest  materia medica had become unused in the historical process. Qianjin Yifang  records that the distribution areas of Dao-di herbs were mainly in the middle and  eastern part of Sichuan province.Aconiti Radix, Lateralis Radix Praeparata,  Zingiberis Rhizoma, Notopterygii Rhizoma et Radix are still the Dao-di herbs of  Sichuan province. According to the book of Bencao Tujing,the main distribution  areas of Dao-di herbs are Chengdu Plain, Yibin and Santai, While Toosendan  Fructus, Chuanxiong Rhizoma, Zanthoxyli Pericarpium, Aconiti Radix are still the  Dao-di herbs of Sichuan province. Ben Cao Gang Mu records the place of origin as  Sichuan.Coptidis Rhizoma, Toosendan Fructus, Cyathulae Radix are still the Dao-di  herbs of Sichuan pro-vince. Yaowu Chuchanbian and Zengding Weiyao Tiaobian  records the place of origin as Sichuan, as well as Kangding, Songpan,  Dujiang-yan, Jiangyou, Nanchong, Ya'an, etc. Moschus, Coptidis Rhizoma, Eucommiae  Cortex, Phellodendri Chinensis Cortex are still the Dao-di herbs of Sichuan  province. The results of this article provide a new understanding of the history  and distribution changes of Dao-di herbs in Sichuan province, and can help to  further understand the formation connotation of Sichuan Dao-di herbs.},

Ninety-six piglets (48 DLY and 48 LCB respectively) without  significant difference in body weight (11.22~{$\pm~$}0.32~kg) were used in a 2~\texttimes ~4  factorial design. Animals were randomly allocated to four treatments, and each  had four replicates with three DLY and three LCB piglets. Treatments were basal  diet (CON) and basal diet with 500~mg/kg IVE, 250~mg/kg ELE and 50~mg/kg  chlortetracycline (CHL) respectively. Animals were placed individually for 7-days  adaptation following 42-days test. Results showed the significant interaction  (p~{$<~$}0.05) between dietary treatments and pig species in activity of total  superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), content of  malondialdehyde (MDA), and {$\alpha$}-tumour necrosis factor (TNF-{$\alpha$}), nuclear factor  erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Nrf2/TNF-{$\alpha$} at mRNA and protein level in  duodenum and jejunum of DLY and LCB piglets. The IVE and ELE increased (p~{$<~$}0.05)  activity of GSH-Px and T-SOD, and the Nrf2/TNF-{$\alpha$} at mRNA and protein level,  however, the decreased (p~{$<~$}0.05) MDA content, and TNF-{$\alpha$} at mRNA and protein  level in duodenum and jejunum were observed. The CHL decreased (p~{$<~$}0.05)  activity of GSH-Px and T-SOD, TNF-{$\alpha$} and Nrf2 at mRNA and protein level in  duodenum, but increased (p~{$<~$}0.05) MDA content and Nrf2/TNF-{$\alpha$} in jejunum. DLY  piglets had higher (p~{$<~$}0.05) nutrient digestibility (organic matter, crude  protein and gross energy), availability (biological value and net protein  utilization), MDA content, and TNF-{$\alpha$} at mRNA and protein level in jejunum, and  had lower (p~{$<~$}0.05) activity of GSH-Px and T-SOD, and Nrf2 and Nrf2/TNF-{$\alpha$} at  mRNA and protein level in duodenum and jejunum than LCB. In conclusion, the  500~mg/kg IVE and 250~mg/kg ELE improved the nutrient availability, and the  improvement of antioxidant capacity is realized by activating the Nrf2/TNF-{$\alpha$} of  duodenum and jejunum. The CHL had adverse effects on antioxidant ability of DLY  and LCB piglets. The results showed that the nutrient digestion and absorption  capacity of DLY were stronger than that of LCB piglets, but the antioxidant  capacity was lower than that of LCB piglets. Therefore, the IVE and ELE are  recommended as a new potential alternative to antibiotics in piglets' diets.},

As biological interpretation relies on accurate structure annotations, the ability to assign confidence to such annotations is a key outstanding problem. We introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines structure database generation,             in silico             annotation, and a confidence score consisting of kernel density p-value estimation and a Support Vector Machine with enforced directionality of features. In evaluation, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at small false discovery rates, and outperforms spectral library search for this purpose. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated twelve novel bile acid conjugates; nine structures were confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. Second, we annotated and manually evaluated 315 molecular structures in human samples currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Third, we applied COSMIC to 17,400 experimental runs and annotated 1,715 structures with high confidence that were absent from spectral libraries.},

RNase T2 genes perform important roles in  plants and have been conserved in the genome of eukaryotic organisms. In this  study we identified 21 EURNS genes in Eucommia ulmoides Oliver (E. ulmoides) and  analyzed their structure, chromosomal location, phylogenetic tree, gene  duplication, stress-related cis-elements, and expression patterns in different  tissues. The length of 21 predicted EURNS proteins ranged from 143 to 374 amino  acids (aa), their molecular weight (MW) ranged from 16.21 to 42.38~kDa, and their  isoelectric point (PI) value ranged from 5.08 to 9.09. Two classifications (class  I~and class III) were obtained from the conserved domains analysis and  phylogenetic tree. EURNS proteins contained a total of 15 motifs. Motif 1, motif  2, motif 3, and motif 7 were distributed in multiple sequences and were similar  to the conserved domain of RNase T2. EURNS genes with similar structure and the  predicted EURNS proteins with conserved motif compositions are in the same group  in the phylogenetic tree. The results of RT-PCR and transcription data showed  that EURNS genes have tissue-specific expression and exhibited obvious trends in  different developmental stages. Gene duplication analysis results indicated that  segment duplication may be the dominant duplication mode in this gene family.  This study provides a theoretical basis for research on the RNase T2 gene family  and lays a foundation for the further study of EURNS genes.},

In this study, the CGA treatment effects on the viability of human hepatoma cells  were investigated by MTT assay. Our data showed that CGA could dose-dependently  inhibit the activity of human hepatoma cells Hep-G2 and Huh-7, but did not affect  the activity and growth of normal human hepatocyte QSG-7701. The genes and  pathways influenced by CGA treatment were explored by RNA sequencing and  bioinformatics analysis, which identified 323 differentially expressed genes  (DEGs) involved in multiple pharmacological signaling pathways such as MAPK,  NF-{$\kappa$}B, apoptosis and TGF-{$\beta$} signaling pathways. Further analyses by real-time  quantitative PCR, Western blot and flow cytometry revealed that CGA effectually  suppressed the noncanonical NF-{$\kappa$}B signaling pathway, meanwhile it activated the  mitochondrial apoptosis of HCC by upregulation of the BH3-only protein Bcl-2  binding component 3 (BBC3).

Nematodes exposed to E. ulmoides  and C. chinensis extracts, starting at the young adult stage, exhibited prolonged  lifespan and increased survival after heat stress as well as upon exposure to the  pathogenic bacterium Photorhabdus luminescens, whereby the survival benefits were  monitored after stress initiation at different adult stages. However, only C.  chinensis had the ability to enhance physical fitness: the swimming behavior and  the pharyngeal pumping rate of C. elegans were improved at day 7 and especially  at day 12 of adulthood. Finally, monitoring the red fluorescence of aged worms  revealed that only C. chinensis extracts caused suppression of intestinal  autofluorescence, a known marker of aging. The results underline the different  modes of action of the tested plants extracts. E. ulmoides improved specifically  the physiological fitness by increasing the survival probability of C. elegans  after stress, while C. chinensis seems to be an overall healthspan enhancer,  reflected in the suppressed autofluorescence, with beneficial effects on physical  as well as physiological fitness. The C. chinensis effects may be hormetic: this  is supported by increased gene expression of hsp-16.1 and by trend, also of  hsp-12.6.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves are the dry leaves of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. Modern studies have shown that Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.  leaves and its extracts have many pharmacological effects, such as regulating  hypothalamus pituitary ovary (HPO) axis function, estrogen like effects,  correcting insulin resistance (IR), regulating lipids, and reducing weight, which  are consistent with the clinical manifestations in polycystic ovary syndrome  (PCOS) patients. PCOS patients often have HPO axis disorder, low estrogen, high  androgen, high IR complication rate, and obesity. Previous preclinical studies  have shown that total flavonoids from Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves (TFEL) can  improve the imbalance in sex hormone secretion in perimenopausal animal models by  regulating the function of the HPO axis. Thus, it is important to understand if  flavonoids are the active parts of Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. leaves that interfere  with polycystic ovary syndrome with insulin resistance (PCOS-IR), and determine  the regulatory role they play in sex hormones and IR? AIM OF THE STUDY:  Investigate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT)  signaling pathway in the ovary and kisspeptin/insulin like growth factor/leptin  receptor1/androgen receptor (Kiss1/IGF-1/LEPR/AR) in the HPO axis to determine  the mechanism of TFEL intervention in a rat model of PCOS-IR model rats.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A rat model of PCOS-IR was established using a high-fat  diet (49~d) combined with letrozole (1~mg/kg{$\cdot$}d, for 28~d). Then, metformin  (300~mg/kg{$\cdot$}d) and TFEL (220~mg/kg{$\cdot$}d, 110~mg/kg{$\cdot$}d, and 55~mg/kg{$\cdot$}d) were  administered continuously for 21 days. At the end of the experiment, samples were  taken and the related indexes were measured. RESULTS: TFEL reduced the body  weight, Lee's index, ovarian index, ovarian area and ovarian volume, increased  serum E(2), SHBG levels and ISI, decreased serum levels of T, LEP, INS, and FBG  (whole blood), and reduced the HOMA-IR in rats with PCOS-IR. TFEL downregulate  Kiss1, IGF-1, and AR in the arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus, and upregulate  Kiss1, downregulate IGF-1 and AR in the pituitary gland, and upregulate Kiss1,  downregulate IGF-1, LEPR, and AR in the ovary of rats with PCOS-IR. TFEL could  downregulate p-IRS-1(Ser307), upregulate IRS-1, p-IRS-1(Tyr895), PI3Kp85{$\alpha$},  p-PI3Kp85{$\alpha$}, AKT, p-AKT, and GLUT4 in the ovary, and ameliorated histopathological  changes in the ovary and pancreas of rats with PCOS-IR. CONCLUSION: TFEL can  inhibit ovarian hyperplasia, regulate disorders of glucose and lipid metabolism  and improve the secretion of sex hormones, by regulating the expression of  PI3K/AKT signaling pathway-related proteins in the ovary and Kiss1/IGF-1/LEPR/AR  in the HPO axis.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG), the active compound extracted from Eucommia ulmoides, Styrax sp. and Forsythia suspensa,  plays the roles in regulating hypertension, inflammation and oxidative stress.  AIMS: Considering that hypertension and inflammation has been proved to  contribute to cardiac remodeling, we tested the effects of PDG on cardiac  hypertrophy (CM). METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used to construct  hypertrophic rats by partial abdominal aortic constriction (AAC)-surgery. PDG  solution (2~mg/ml) was used to treat AAC-induced rats by intraperitoneal  injection at low dose (L-PDG, 2.5~mg/kg per day), medium dose (M-PDG, 5~mg/kg per  day), and high dose (H-PDG, 7.5~mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks post AAC-surgery. CM  was evaluated by the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight ratio  (LVW/BW), left ventricular wall thickness by H\&E staining, and collagen content  deposit by Masson's staining. Further, isoproterenol (ISO) and phenylephrine (PE)  were used to produce cellular models of CM in neonatal rat ventricular  cardiomyocytes (NRVMs). PDG pre-treated NRVMs 2~h at low dose (L-PDG, 2.5~{$\mu$}g/ml),  medium dose (M-PDG, 5~{$\mu$}g/ml), and high dose (H-PDG, 7.5~{$\mu$}g/ml) for 24~h with or  without PE- and ISO-stimulation. CM was evaluated by the expressions of  hypertrophic biomarkers. Next, the hypertrophic biomarkers and pro-inflammatory  cytokines were measured using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), the  expressions of protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin  (mTOR)/transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) signaling pathway were  determined by Western blotting. RESULTS: PDG treatment prevented cardiac  histomorphology damages, decreased upregulations of hypertrophic biomarkers, and  prevented fibrosis and inflammation after pressure overload resulting from  AAC-surgery. Consistently, PDG remarkably inhibited the changes of cardiomyocyte  hypertrophic biomarkers and inflammatory responses in cellular models of CM.  Interestingly, PDG administration inhibited the activation of AKT/mTOR/NF-kB  signaling pathway both in vivo and in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: PDG prevents  AAC-induced CM in vivo, PE- and ISO-induced CM in vitro. The AKT/mTOR/NF-kB  signaling pathway could be the potential therapeutic target involved in the  protection of PDG. These findings provide novel evidence that PDG might be a  promising therapeutic strategy for CM.},

Therefore, genomic-wide association study was  performed to exploit the genetic loci maybe involved in biosynthetic pathways of  5 leaf inclusions (aucubin, chlorogenic acid, gutta-percha, polyphenols, total  flavonoids). It was shown that contents of the 5 leaf metabolites have a wide  variation following normal distribution. A total of 2 013 102 single nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) markers were identified in a population containing 62  individual clones. Through genome-wide association study analysis, many SNP loci  were identified perhaps associated with phenotypes of the leaf inclusions. Higher  transcriptional levels of the candidate genes denoted by significant SNPs in  leaves suggested they may be involved in biosynthesis of the leaf inclusions.  These genetic loci provide with invaluable information for further studies on the  gene functions in biosynthesis of the leaf inclusions and selective breeding of  the plus trees.},

Here, we identified three  novel Eucommia ulmoides TPT isoforms-EuTPT1, 3, and 5, which synthesized TPI in  vitro without other components. Crystal structure analysis of EuTPT3 revealed a  dimeric architecture with a central hydrophobic tunnel. Mutation of Cys94 and  Ala95 on the central hydrophobic tunnel no longer synthesizd TPI, indicating that  Cys94 and Ala95 were essential for forming the dimeric architecture of  ultralong-chain TPTs and TPI biosynthesis. A spatiotemporal analysis of the  physiological function of TPI in E. ulmoides suggested that it is involved in  seed development and maturation. Thus, our analysis provides functional and  mechanistic insights into TPI biosynthesis and uncovers biological roles of TPI  in plants.},

  abstract = {For Alzheimer's disease (AD), there is still no effective treatment strategy. Pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG) is one of the major lignans isolated from Eucommia  ulmoides. It is endowed with multiple pharmacological activities, including  anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer activities. In this study, we  investigated the potential neuroprotective functions of PDG in AD. Mice model  with AD was established adopting stereotactic hippocampal injection of A{$\beta$}1-42  (410\,pmol/mouse), and 3\,days later, mice were administrated with 5 and 10\,mg/kg  PDG by intragastric administration every day for 3\,weeks. Morris water maze and  Y-maze tests demonstrated that PDG treatment could markedly reverse  A{$\beta$}1-42-induced memory impairment in mice. It is found that PDG restrained the  release of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor {$\alpha$} and interleukin  1{$\beta$}), reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde, and promoted the activity of  the antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase and catalase) by quantitative  real-time-PCR, colorimetric method and ELISA assay. Western blot assay results  have shown that PDG could also upregulate the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and downregulate  cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3 expressions, thereby inhibiting neuronal  apoptosis. Furthermore, PDG also significantly reduced the expression of  Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the activation of nuclear factor-{$\kappa$}B (NF-{$\kappa$}B) p65,  and promoted nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1  (HO-1) expressions. In conclusion, PDG can attenuate neuroinflammation, neuronal  apoptosis and oxidative stress through the TLR4/NF-{$\kappa$}B and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways, and  ameliorate memory dysfunction induced by A{$\beta$}1-42 in mice.},

AIM OF THE  STUDY: The exact role and underlying mechanism of Osteo-F herbal formula on bone  formation in osteoporosis was investigated in the present study. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: OVX mice were treated with 0.9, 9 and 90~mg/kg of Osteo-F for 4 weeks.  Bone tissues including fourth to sixth lumbar vertebrae (LV) and femur were  collected to analyze the bone mineral density (BMD). In addition, serum  biomarkers were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expressions  of collagen, BMP-2 and osteopontin were determined in tibia to clarify the bone  anabolic effects of Osteo-F in osteoporosis. RESULTS: The levels of BMD in both  of fourth to sixth LV and femur were significantly increased by Osteo-F treatment  in OVX mice. Bone mineral content (BMC) was also elevated in Osteo-F-treated LV  and femoral bone tissues. In addition, serum osteocalcin was markedly increased  by Osteo-F in osteoporotic mice. Serum ALP and bALP levels were neutralized in  Osteo-F 90 mg/kg-administered mice. Furthermore, Osteo-F treatment dramatically  increased the mRNA expressions of collagen type I, BMP-2 and OPN in tibial bone  specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Osteo-F ameliorated bone loss by increasing bone forming  molecules including BMP-2 and OPN in osteoporosis. Osteo-F, a newly developed  herbal formula, may be an alternative material for the management of osteoporosis  with bone anabolic effects.},

  abstract = {Quercetin and crocin are the main active constituents of Eucommia and Gardenia species, respectively. This study was conducted to explore the effects of  quercetin and crocin on fat reduction and renal fibrosis and the relationship of  these compounds with autophagy. First, a model of high-fat diet- and  streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes was established and then subjected model  animals to 8 weeks of metformin, quercetin and crocin gavage. Then, a high  glucose-induced rat mesangial cells (RMCs) model was established, and these cells  were cocultured with quercetin and crocin. The results showed that quercetin and  crocin can decrease fasting blood glucose levels, reduce fat accumulation in the  liver, alleviate renal fibrosis, and reduce blood lipid levels. Quercetin and  crocin increased autophagy-related protein (LC3, Atg5, Beclin-1 and p-AMPK)  levels in the liver and decreased autophagy-related protein (LC3, Atg5, Beclin-1  and p-AMPK) levels in the kidneys. Moreover, quercetin and crocin inhibited the  excessive proliferation of RMCs induced by high-glucose (HG) conditions,  decreased autophagy-related protein (LC3, Atg5, Beclin-1 and p-AMPK) levels, and  decreased TGF-{$\beta$}1 expression. Importantly, cotreatment with quercetin and crocin  had a more significant effect than treatment with either compound alone. These  results suggest that combined administration of quercetin and crocin can more  significantly reduce blood glucose/lipid levels and improve renal fibrosis than  administration of either compound alone and that AMPK-dependent autophagy might  be involved in this process. Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. and Gardenia could be  developed as drugs for Type 2 diabetes treatment.},

Our previous study demonstrated that the oral  administration of 5\% Eucommia leaf extract (ELE) or ELE aroma treatment (ELE  aroma) produced anti-obesity effects. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated  the effects of ELE on glycolysis and lipid metabolism in male Sprague-Dawley  rats, as well as the effects of ELE on BDNF in rat hypothalamus. METHODS AND  RESULTS: A significant reduction and a reduction tendency in the respiratory  quotient were observed in association with 5\% ELE and ELE aroma treatment,  respectively. Furthermore, RT-qPCR results showed significant increases in Cpt2,  Acad, Complex II, and Complex V mRNA levels in the liver with both treatments. In  addition, in rat hypothalamus, significant elevations in BDNF, Akt, PLC{$\gamma$} proteins  and CREB phosphorylation were observed in the 5\% ELE group and the ELE aroma  group. Furthermore, the Ras protein was significantly increased in the ELE aroma  group. On the other hand, significant dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 was observed by  the western blotting in the 5\% ELE group and the ELE aroma group. CONCLUSION:  These findings suggest that the ELE treatment enhances the lipid metabolism and  increases the aerobic glycolytic pathway, while ELE-induced BDNF may affect such  energy regulation. Therefore, ELE has the possibility to control metabolic  syndrome.},

  abstract = {The Blue Biotechnology and Ecotoxicology Culture Collection (LEGE-CC) holds a vast number of cyanobacteria whose chemical richness is still largely unknown. To  expedite its bioactivity screening we developed a natural products library. Sixty  strains and four environmental samples were chromatographed, using a  semiautomatic HPLC system, yielding 512 fractions that were tested for their  cytotoxic activity against 2D and 3D models of human colon carcinoma (HCT 116),  and non-cancerous cell line hCMEC/D3. Six fractions showed high cytotoxicity  against 2D and 3D cell models (group A), and six other fractions were selected by  their effects on 3D cells (group B). The metabolome of each group was organized  and characterized using the MolNetEnhancer workflow, and its processing with  MetaboAnalyst allowed discrimination of the mass features with the highest fold  change, and thus the ones that might be bioactive. Of those, mass features  without precedented identification were mostly found in group A, indicating seven  possible novel bioactive molecules, alongside in silico putative annotation of  five cytotoxic compounds. Manual dereplication of group B tentatively identified  nine pheophytin and pheophorbide derivatives. Our approach enabled the selection  of 7 out of 60 cyanobacterial strains for anticancer drug discovery, providing  new data concerning the chemical composition of these cyanobacteria.},

  abstract = {Momordica plant species (Cucurbitaceae), have been used for centuries in traditional medicine and for nutritional purposes. Plants from this family are  thus claimed to be phytochemically rich, representing an inexhaustible source of  natural products. However, the chemical space of these Momordica species has not  yet been fully decoded, and due to the inherent complexity of plant metabolomes,  the characterization of the Momordica phytochemistry remains challenging. Thus,  in this study we propose the use of molecular networking to unravel the molecular  families within the metabolomes of four Momordica species (M. cardiospermoides,  M. balsamina, M. charantia and M. foetida) and highlight the relevance of  molecular networking in exploring the chemotaxonomy of these plants. In silico  annotation tools (Network Annotation Propagation and DEREPLICATOR) and an  unsupervised substructure identification tool (MS2LDA) were also explored to  complement the classical molecular networking output and integration using  MolNetEnhancer within GNPS. This allowed for the visualisation of chemical  classes and the variety of substructures within the molecular families. The use  of computational tools in this study highlighted various classes of metabolites,  such as a wide range of flavonoids, terpenoids and lipids. Herein, these species  are revealed to be phytochemically rich plants consisting of many biologically  active metabolites differentially distributed within the different species, with  the metabolome of M. cardiospermoides dereplicated in this paper for the first  time.},

In this work, we present a comprehensive  characterization of the cell-free culture filtrate (CF) and precipitated fraction  (PF) of Bacillus cabrialesii TE3(T) showing an effective inhibition of spot  blotch. Our results indicated that CF produced by B. cabrialesii TE3(T) inhibits  the growth of B. sorokiniana through stable metabolites (after autoclaving and  proteinase K treatment). Antifungal metabolites in CF and PF were explored by an  integrated genomic-metabolomic approach. Genome-mining revealed that strain  TE3(T) contains the biosynthetic potential to produce wide spectrum antifungal  (surfactin, fengycin, and rhizocticin A) and antibacterial metabolites  (bacillaene, bacilysin, bacillibactin, and subtilosin A), and through  bioactivity-guided LC-ESI-MS/MS approach we determined that a lipopeptide complex  of surfactin and fengycin homologs was responsible for antifungal activity  exhibited by B. cabrialesii TE3(T) against the studied phytopathogen. In  addition, our results demonstrate that i) a lipopeptide complex inhibits B.  sorokiniana by disrupting its cytoplasmatic membrane and ii) reduced spot blotch  disease by 93 \%. These findings show the potential application of metabolites  produced by strain TE3(T) against B. sorokiniana and provide the first insight  into antifungal metabolites produced by the novel Bacillus species, Bacillus  cabrialesii.},

Control initiatives are carried out in regions of high infestation and incidence of  accidents caused by scorpions OBJECTIVE: In this study, we aimed to analyze the  anti-scorpionic activity of fungal isolates obtained from a cemetery in Brazil.  MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of thirteen fungi were subjected to a bioassay  test against Tityus serrulatus, and the two isolates with the highest  scorpionicidal activity were selected for molecular identification through  sequencing of the ITS DNA hypervariable region and large-scale cultivation on  liquid medium for secondary metabolite extraction. The crude extracts were  partitioned by solid-phase extraction, and the resulting purified extracts were  tested for anti-scorpionic activity. The extracts from one of the isolates  presented better results and were submitted to UPLC-MS/MS. The metabolomics data  were submitted to GNPS website for Molecular Networking and MASST searches. We  also performed a MolNetEnhancer analysis to identify the chemical classes of the  molecules found in the samples. RESULTS: The most promising fungal isolate was  identified as Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 which has 98\% of similarity to  Paecilomyces formosus. The sub-fractions C and D had the best activity against  the scorpions (54 and 32\% mortality, respectively). Molecular Networking and  MolNetEnhancer revealed a range of molecular classes in our extracts that are  known to include bioactive metabolites from Paecilomyces species. CONCLUSIONS:  The scorpionicidal activity of Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 and its secondary  metabolites may provide new alternative compounds for biological and chemical  control of scorpions from the species T. serrulatus. Paecilomyces sp. CMAA1686 is  an isolate that has great potential for isolation of secondary metabolites.},

Newborn screening  dried blood spot (DBS) samples have great potential for the study of early  biochemical markers of disease. To study DBS strengths and limitations in the  context of ASD research, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of newborns later  diagnosed with ASD. We performed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics on DBS  from 37 case-control pairs randomly selected from the iPSYCH sample. After  preprocessing using MZmine 2.41, metabolites were putatively annotated using  mzCloud, GNPS feature-based molecular networking, and MolNetEnhancer. A total of  4360 mass spectral features were detected, of which 150 (113 unique) could be  putatively annotated at a high confidence level. Chemical structure information  at a broad level could be retrieved for 1009 metabolites, covering 31 chemical  classes. Although no clear distinction between cases and controls was revealed,  our method covered many metabolites previously associated with ASD, suggesting  that biochemical markers of ASD are present at birth and may be monitored during  newborn screening. Additionally, we observed that gestational age, age at  sampling, and month of birth influence the metabolomic profiles of newborn DBS,  which informs us on the important confounders to address in future studies.},

Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the collection of tandem mass spectra of small molecules from hundreds of thousands of environments. To identify which molecules are present in a sample, one can search mass spectra collected from the sample against millions of molecular structures in small molecule databases. The existing approaches are based on chemistry domain knowledge, and they fail to explain many of the peaks in mass spectra of small molecules. Here, we present molDiscovery, a mass spectral database search method that improves both efficiency and accuracy of small molecule identification by learning a probabilistic model to match small molecules with their mass spectra. A search of over 8 million spectra from the Global Natural Product Social molecular networking infrastructure shows that molDiscovery correctly identify six times more unique small molecules than previous methods.},

However, during ionization, molecules commonly form multiple ion species with different fragmentation behavior. As a result, the fragmentation spectra of these ion species often remain unconnected in tandem mass spectrometry-based molecular networks, leading to redundant and disconnected sub-networks of the same compound classes. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop Ion Identity Molecular Networking (IIMN) that integrates chromatographic peak shape correlation analysis into molecular networks to connect and collapse different ion species of the same molecule. The new feature relationships improve network connectivity for structurally related molecules, can be used to reveal unknown ion-ligand complexes, enhance annotation within molecular networks, and facilitate the expansion of spectral reference libraries. IIMN is integrated into various open source feature finding tools and the GNPS environment. Moreover, IIMN-based spectral libraries with a broad coverage of ion species are publicly available.},

  abstract = {COVID-19 is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities, including the deficiencies in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+ ) and glutathione metabolism. Here it is investigated if administration of a mixture of combined metabolic activators (CMAs) consisting of glutathione and NAD+ precursors can restore metabolic function and thus aid the recovery of COVID-19 patients. CMAs include l-serine, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, nicotinamide riboside, and l-carnitine tartrate, salt form of l-carnitine. Placebo-controlled, open-label phase 2 study and double-blinded phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to investigate the time of symptom-free recovery on ambulatory patients using CMAs. The results of both studies show that the time to complete recovery is significantly shorter in the CMA group (6.6~vs 9.3 d) in phase 2 and (5.7~vs 9.2 d) in phase 3 trials compared to placebo group. A comprehensive analysis of the plasma metabolome and proteome reveals major metabolic changes. Plasma levels of proteins and metabolites associated with inflammation and antioxidant metabolism are significantly improved in patients treated with CMAs as compared to placebo. The results show that treating patients infected with COVID-19 with CMAs lead to a more rapid symptom-free recovery, suggesting a role for such a therapeutic regime in the treatment of infections leading to respiratory problems.},

  abstract = {Disease progression prediction and therapeutic drug target discovery for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are particularly important, as there is still no effective strategy for severe COVID-19 patient treatment. Herein, we performed multi-platform omics analysis of serial plasma and urine samples collected from patients during the course of COVID-19. Integrative analyses of these omics data revealed several potential therapeutic targets, such as ANXA1 and CLEC3B. Molecular changes in plasma indicated dysregulation of macrophage and suppression of T cell functions in severe patients compared to those in non-severe patients. Further, we chose 25 important molecular signatures as potential biomarkers for the prediction of disease severity. The prediction power was validated using corresponding urine samples and plasma samples from new COVID-19 patient cohort, with AUC reached to 0.904 and 0.988, respectively. In conclusion, our omics data proposed not only potential therapeutic targets, but also biomarkers for understanding the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence methods offer exciting new capabilities for the discovery of biological mechanisms from raw data because they are able to detect vastly more complex patterns of association that cannot be captured by classical statistical tests. Among these methods, deep neural networks are currently among the most advanced approaches and, in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to perform excellently for a variety of difficult tasks. Despite that applications of this type of networks to high-dimensional omics data and, most importantly, meaningful interpretation of the results returned from such models in a biomedical context remains an open problem. Here we present, an approach applying a CNN to nonimage data for feature selection. Our pipeline, DeepFeature, can both successfully transform omics data into a form that is optimal for fitting a CNN model and can also return sets of the most important genes used internally for computing predictions. Within the framework, the Snowfall compression algorithm is introduced to enable more elements in the fixed pixel framework, and region accumulation and element decoder is developed to find elements or genes from the class activation maps. In comparative tests for cancer type prediction task, DeepFeature simultaneously achieved superior predictive performance and better ability to discover key pathways and biological processes meaningful for this context. Capabilities offered by the proposed framework can enable the effective use of powerful deep learning methods to facilitate the discovery of causal mechanisms in high-dimensional biomedical data.},

  abstract = {As the major component of cell membranes, phosphatidylcholine (PC) is synthesized de novo in the Kennedy pathway and then undergoes extensive deacylation-reacylation remodeling via Lands' cycle. The re-acylation is catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) and among the four LPCAT members in human, the LPCAT3 preferentially introduces polyunsaturated acyl onto the sn-2 position of lysophosphatidylcholine, thereby modulating the membrane fluidity and membrane protein functions therein. Combining the x-ray crystallography and the cryo-electron microscopy, we determined the structures of LPCAT3 in apo-, acyl donor-bound, and acyl receptor-bound states. A reaction chamber was revealed in the LPCAT3 structure where the lysophosphatidylcholine and arachidonoyl-CoA were positioned in two tunnels connected near to the catalytic center. A side pocket was found expanding the tunnel for the arachidonoyl CoA and holding the main body of arachidonoyl. The structural and functional analysis provides the basis for the re-acylation of lysophosphatidylcholine and the substrate preference during the reactions.},

  abstract = {Objective               Chronic alcohol consumption is an important cause of liver-related deaths. Specific intestinal microbiota profiles are associated with susceptibility or resistance to alcoholic liver disease in both mice and humans. We aimed to identify the mechanisms by which targeting intestinal microbiota can improve alcohol-induced liver lesions.                                         Design               We used human associated mice, a mouse model of alcoholic liver disease transplanted with the intestinal microbiota of alcoholic patients and used the prebiotic, pectin, to modulate the intestinal microbiota. Based on metabolomic analyses, we focused on microbiota tryptophan metabolites, which are ligands of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Involvement of the AhR pathway was assessed using both a pharmacological approach and AhR-deficient mice.                                         Results                                Pectin treatment modified the microbiome and metabolome in human microbiota-associated alcohol-fed mice, leading to a specific faecal signature. High production of bacterial tryptophan metabolites was associated with an improvement of liver injury. The AhR agonist Ficz (6-formylindolo (3,2-b) carbazole) reduced liver lesions, similarly to prebiotic treatment. Conversely, inactivation of the                 ahr                 gene in alcohol-fed AhR                 knock-out                 mice abrogated the beneficial effects of the prebiotic. Importantly, patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis have low levels of bacterial tryptophan derivatives that are AhR agonists.                                                        Conclusions               Improvement of alcoholic liver disease by targeting the intestinal microbiota involves the AhR pathway, which should be considered as a new therapeutic target.},

Eucommia ulmoides               is one of the traditional Chinese medicine herbs, which has been used to recover functions of the kidney. However, its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the effects and protective mechanism of               Eucommia ulmoides               extract on renal injury caused by long-term high purine diets in rats. SD rats underwent an intragastric adenine (200 mg kg               -1               d               -1               ) administration for 9 weeks and were treated for 15 weeks. The results demonstrated that               Eucommia ulmoides               extract significantly reduced serum Cre and BUN levels in rats. H\&E and Masson's trichrome stains showed notable lowering of the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the formation of fibrous tissues and collagen fibers, and improvement in the pathological morphology of kidneys. It also suppressed the protein and mRNA expressions of TGF-{$\beta$}1 and {$\alpha$}-SMA and enhanced E-cadherin expression. Meanwhile,               Eucommia ulmoides               extract prominently inhibited the mRNA expression of Col I, Col III, Col IV, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 and promoted expressions of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Through our study, it is the first time to prove that               Eucommia ulmoides               extract could ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis and may involve in the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation enzyme (MMPs/TIMPs) system, promotion of the expression of E-cadherin, and suppression of expressions of TGF-{$\beta$}1 and {$\alpha$}-SMA. The results provide a significant implication for the utilization of               Eunomia Ulmoides               extract as functional foods to enhance renal functions and improve renal injury caused by high purine diets.},

Many of the tested plants in this study have been traditionally used in the treatment of Diabetes mellitus type 2 and associated symptoms in different cultural areas. Additionally, hypoglycemic effects, such as a decrease in blood glucose concentration, have been demonstrated               in vivo               for these plants. In order to determine the mode of action, the plants were prepared as methanolic and aqueous extracts and tested for their effects on intestinal glucose and fructose absorption in Caco2 cells. The results of this screening showed significant and reproducible inhibition of glucose uptake between 40 and 80\% by methanolic extracts made from the fruits of               Aronia melanocarpa               ,               Cornus officinalis               ,               Crataegus pinnatifida               ,               Lycium chinense               , and               Vaccinium myrtillus               ; the leaves of               Brassica oleracea               ,               Juglans regia               , and               Peumus boldus               ; and the roots of               Adenophora triphylla               . Furthermore, glucose uptake was inhibited between 50 and 70\% by aqueous extracts made from the bark of               Eucommia ulmoides               and the fruit skin of               Malus domestica               .

Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the collection of tandem mass spectra of small molecules from hundreds of thousands of environments. To identify which molecules are present in a sample, one can search mass spectra collected from the sample against millions of molecular structures in small molecule databases. The existing approaches are based on chemistry domain knowledge, and they fail to explain many of the peaks in mass spectra of small molecules. Here, we present molDiscovery, a mass spectral database search method that improves both efficiency and accuracy of small molecule identification by learning a probabilistic model to match small molecules with their mass spectra. A search of over 8 million spectra from the Global Natural Product Social molecular networking infrastructure shows that molDiscovery correctly identify six times more unique small molecules than previous methods.},

Meanwhile, obvious variation in albumen amino acids and  yolk volatile compounds were inspected as dietary supplementation E. ulmoides  extract, especially in D group, implied that the flavor of egg would change under  high-level E. ulmoides extract treatment. Besides, villus height and villus  height to crypt depth ratio of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum in D group were also  significantly higher than that of in A group, indicating high-level E. ulmoides  extract contributed to nutrient adsorption via intestinal histology changing.  Moreover, the richness, diversity, and composition of gut microbiota in D group  also significantly altered with a comparison of A group. These variation caused  gut microbiota in D group major enriched in the KEGG pathway of insulin signing  pathway, systemic lupus erythematosus, and bacterial invasion of epithelial  cells, which were conducive to egg production elevation via facilitating nutrient  adsorption, inflammation relieving, blood lipid amelioration, and insulin  resistance alleviation.

  abstract = {Fresh-cut potato slices are very popular in the service of hot-pots. However, the gelatinized starch easily escaping from the potato cells during cooking causes  the thickening of beef tallow or soup in the hot-pot. Thus, acetic acid is  considered for solving the problem of potato slices. Besides, the nutritional and  quality characteristics of potato slices are also evaluated in this study.  Results show that 1.0\%-1.5\% (v/v) acetic acid treatment can decrease mass loss  and starch digestion rate, and delay the degradation of ascorbic acid and  deterioration of color and texture of potato slices. Such treatment also inhibits  membrane oxidation and PPO activity, and increase the total phenolic accumulation  of potato slice in 7-day storage. The cell wall integrity of the potato slice is  strengthened by acetic acid treatment, providing a strategy for the improvement  of the boiling resistance of potato slice, and endowing potato slice with the  digesting resistance. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Acid pretreatment would cause the  intensification of potato cell wall, which finally decrease the in vitro  digestibility through decrease of leakage of gelatinized starch from potato cell  and the contact between gelatinized starch and digesting enzyme. This observation  proved that the integrity of cell structure in vegetable is important for their  processing quality improvement (especially for their hardness improvement after  heating or fermentation).},

In recent years, deep eutectic solvents (DESs)  have been obtaining increase attention in green chemistry area since its  sustainability, safety and biodegradability. In this study, an efficient DES  composed of choline chloride and L-(+)-ascorbic acid with a molar ratio of 2:1  performed higher efficacy on the extraction of target compounds (including  iridoids, phenolic acids and flavonoids) in Eucommia ulmoides leaves than 50\%  methanol solution. Considering the extraction efficacy and time consumption,  microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) was selected and the operational conditions,  including power of microwave, liquid/solid ratio and irradiation time were  optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Water was used as anti-solvent  to recover ten target analytes from DES with recovery yields of 97.59\%, 94.91\%,  96.09\%, 90.66\%, 95.16\%, 87.33\%, 86.57\%, 82.15\%, 89.28\% and 80.75\% for eucommiol  (EU), aucubin (AU), geniposidic acid (GA), chlorogenic acid (CA), asperuloside  (AP), rutin (RU), kaempferol-3-O-sambubioside (KS), isoquercitrin (IQ),  kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (KR) and astragaline (AS), respectively. By combining  the DES-based MAE and quantitative analysis of multi-components by single mark  (QAMS) methods, the contents of ten compounds in the leaves of Eucommia ulmoides  were determined to clarify the relationship between the accumulation of secondary  metabolites and the harvest period. It was found that the contents of main  ingredients reached the highest during May to October. The period appears to be  the best harvest period for Eucommia ulmoides leaves. This study provides a novel  strategy for the harvesting, processing, and quality control of the raw materials  from Eucommia ulmoides leaves.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In traditional Chinese medicine, the herbal pair, Radix Achyranthis Bidentatae (RAB) and Eucommiae Cortex (EC), is widely used to treat osteoporosis.  Herein, we determined whether this herbal pair can be used to ameliorate  glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) and find its optimal dosage in  zebrafish. METHODS: The characteristics of the aqueous extract of RAB and EC were  separately characterized using high-performance liquid chromatography.  Osteoporosis was induced in 5-day post-fertilization zebrafish larvae by exposing  them to 10~{$\mu$}mol/L dexamethasone (Dex) for 96~h. Seven combinations of different  ratios of RAB and EC were co-administered. Treatment efficacy was determined by  calculating zebrafish vertebral area and sum brightness, via alizarin red  staining, and by detecting alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Multiple  regression analysis was conducted to test the optimal dosage ratio. RESULTS:  According to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015), {$\beta$}-ecdysone ({$\beta$}-Ecd) is a major  bioactive marker in RAB extract, while pinoresinol diglucoside (PDG) is the major  marker in EC extract. Both of {$\beta$}-Ecd and PDG content values aligned with the  Chinese Pharmacopoeia standards. Treatment with 10~{$\mu$}mol/L Dex reduced zebrafish  vertebral area, sum brightness, and ALP activity, but RAB and EC attenuated these  effects. Combining 50~\textmu g/mL RAB and 50~\textmu g/mL EC was optimal for preventing GIOP  in zebrafish. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was  used to evaluate the mRNA expression of osteogenesis-related genes. A treatment  of 10~{$\mu$}mol/L Dex decreased runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2),  osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1), bone {$\gamma$}-carboxyglutamic acid-containing protein  (BGLAP), and {$\beta$}-catenin levels. This effect was counteracted by RAB and EC  co-treatment (P~{$<~$}0.05). Additionally, the effect of using the two herbal  extracts together was better than single-herb treatments separately. These  results demonstrated that RAB and EC preserve osteoblast function in the presence  of GC. The best mass ratio was 1:1. CONCLUSION: RAB and EC herbal pair could  ameliorate GC-induced effects in zebrafish, with 1:1 as the optimal dosage ratio.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Qing' E Formula (QEF) is a compound preparation that was originally recorded in the 'Prescriptions of the Bureau of  Taiping People's Welfare Pharmacy' during the Song Dynasty (10th century CE). It  consists of four Chinese medicinal herbs, Eucommiae Cortex (Eucommia ulmoides),  Psoraleae Fructus (Psoralea corylifolium), Juglandis Semen (Juglans regia), and  Garlic Rhizoma. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), QEF has the  ability to tonify the kidney and strengthen muscle and bone. According to the  'kidney governing bone' theory in TCM, QEF is also used to treat the symptoms of  climacteric syndrome, especially osteoporosis caused by reduced production of  estrogen during the perimenopausal period; however, the therapeutic roles of the  individual components of the QEF and their compatibility within the formula has  not been investigated. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, the compatibility  mechanism and estrogen-like action properties of the four herbal components in  the QEF was elucidated according to the organizing principle of Chinese medicine  formulas using both in vitro and in vivo models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The  estrogen-like effects of QEF and its herbal components were investigated in MCF7  and HEK293~cells as well as ovariectomized (OVX) rats. The estrogen-like effects  of the QEF and its components were analyzed in vitro using Cell Counting Kit-8  and Luciferase reporter gene assays. In the in vivo studies, the blood plasma  levels of hormones, lipids, neurotransmitters, aromatase, superoxide dismutase  (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured through enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The histological morphologies of the target organs  after exposure to QEF were investigated by HE staining and immunohistochemical  methods. The expression levels of estrogen pathway-related proteins and genes in  the OVX rats were measured by Western blotting and real time quantitative PCR  (RT-qPCR), respectively. RESULTS: The in vitro results showed that the QEF,  Eucommia (EC) and Psoralea (PF) promoted the proliferation of MCF-7~cells and  upregulated the expression of ER{$\alpha$}, ER{$\beta$} and pS2 genes in the MCF-7~cells. Notably,  the QEF demonstrated the most active estrogen-like effects compared to the  individual ingredients. The in vivo results showed that the QEF, EC, and PF  increased the uterine coefficient, upregulated the expression of both ERs (ER{$\alpha$}  and ER{$\beta$}) in the uterus, and increased blood serum hormone levels. QEF and its  individual components ameliorated menopausal-derived lipid metabolism  dysfunction, increased neurotransmitter production by stimulating the adrenal  glands, enhanced the antioxidant activity in the serum by increasing the  concentration of SOD, reversed ovariectomy-derived atrophy in the uterus, and  reduced the weight gain associated with estrogen reduction in the OVX rats. The  QEF also antagonize the loss of appetite of OVX animals caused by feeding  Psoralea alone, which could explain the compatibility mechanism of Qing' E  Formula with reducing toxicity and increasing efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The  estrogen-like effects of Eucommia and Psoralea were mainly mediated through  activation of ER{$\alpha$} and ER{$\beta$}. The phytoestrogen components regulated hormone  production and the expression of related proteins and genes, which indicated that  these components exhibited estrogen-like therapeutic effects. However, the QEF  showed the greatest estrogen-like effects compared to the individual components.  Overall, this corroborated the therapeutic prowess of the QEF and clarified the  pharmacodynamic interactions between the different components extracts in the  QEF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) infection triggers the innate and adaptive immune responses. Eucommia ulmoides Oliv., Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino, and  Curcuma longa L. extracts exhibit various immunomodulatory effects. OBJECTIVE:  This study aimed to determine the effects of 3 extracts used in Traditional  Chinese Medicine (TCM) on cytokine production in peripheral blood mononuclear  cells (PBMCs) obtained from patients with TB. DESIGN: The research team performed  an in vitro study with self controls. SETTING: The study took place at the  Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,  Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: 18 patients diagnosed with pulmonary TB were enrolled in  the study. INTERVENTION: Purified protein derivative (PPD)-stimulated PBMCs were  cultured for 48 h in the presence and absence of 0.05 or 0.1 mg/mL of herbal  extracts. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cytokine levels of interferon (IFN)-{$\gamma$}, interleukin  (IL)-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-{$\alpha$} and transforming growth factor  (TGF)-{$\beta$}1 in the culture supernatant were measured. RESULTS: C longa L., E  ulmoides Oliv. and G pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino extracts decreased IFN-{$\gamma$}  production in PPD-stimulated PBMCs. C longa L. extract did not exhibit a marked  and consistent effect on the production of IL-10, IL-12, TNF-{$\alpha$} and TGF-{$\beta$}1. E  ulmoides Oliv. extract increased the production of IL-10, TNF-{$\alpha$} and TGF-{$\beta$}1. G  pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino extract increased the production of IL-10, IL-12,  TNF-{$\alpha$} and TGF-{$\beta$}1. CONCLUSION: These results show that G pentaphyllum (Thunb.)  Makino might enhance cell immunity since it increased the production of IL-12 and  TNF-{$\alpha$} with dose effect.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eucommia ulmoides (E. ulmoides) leaves are included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, and are traditionally used to treat  hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and other diseases. Numerous pharmacological  studies have shown that E. ulmoides has a good effect on lowering blood lipids  and can improve obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver. AIM: To study the mechanism  of E. ulmoides leaves in regulating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by combining  prediction and validation. METHODS: Using network pharmacology, and molecular  docking to predict E. ulmoides in regulating the action mechanism and potential  active ingredients of nonalcoholic fatty liver, large hole adsorption resin  enrichment active sites, in vitro experiments were performed to verify its  fat-lowering effect and mechanism. RESULTS: The major components of E. ulmoides  leaves exhibited good combination with lipid metabolism-regulating core proteins,  particularly flavonoids. EUL 50 significantly reduced lipid accumulation, and  increased PPAR{$\gamma$}. Compared with the control group, the autophagy level increased  after the administration of EUL 50. PPAR{$\gamma$} decreased significantly after the  addition of chloroquine (CQ, autophagy inhibitor). CONCLUSION: The active  ingredients in E. ulmoides leaves regulating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are  mainly flavonoids and phenolics. EUL 50 may play a role in lowering lipids by  regulating PPAR{$\gamma$} expression through inducing autophagy.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Advances in genome sequencing have produced hundreds of thousands of bacterial genome sequences, many of which have integrated prophages derived from temperate bacteriophages. These prophages play key roles by influencing bacterial metabolism, pathogenicity, antibiotic resistance, and defense against viral attack. However, they vary considerably even among related bacterial strains, and they are challenging to identify computationally and to extract precisely for comparative genomic analyses. Here, we describe DEPhT, a multimodal tool for prophage discovery and extraction. It has three run modes that facilitate rapid screening of large numbers of bacterial genomes, precise extraction of prophage sequences, and prophage annotation. DEPhT uses genomic architectural features that discriminate between phage and bacterial sequences for efficient prophage discovery, and targeted homology searches for precise prophage extraction. DEPhT is designed for prophage discovery in Mycobacterium genomes but can be adapted broadly to other bacteria. We deploy DEPhT to demonstrate that prophages are prevalent in Mycobacterium strains but are absent not only from the few well-characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, but also are absent from all {$\sim$}30 000 sequenced M. tuberculosis strains.},

In addition to these structural and content changes we have added full taxonomic  descriptions for all microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from  both NP Classifier and ClassyFire. We have also performed manual curation to  review all entries with incomplete configurational assignments and have  integrated data from external resources, including CyanoMetDB. Finally, we have  improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a  dashboard for taxonomic origin.

Main funding source(s): The National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China                                         Background               ~Acute heart failure (AHF) is a significant public health problem related to the high mortality and rehospitalization rate of patients. Although drug development is never interrupted, no single drug has been proven to play a decisive role in improving the survival of AHF patients. In China, multi-component traditional Chinese medicine~has been widely~used to treat AHF. As a Chinese herbal injection included in medical insurance, Yiqi Fumai Injection can reduce the level of NT-proBNP in AHF patients, improve heart function, and alleviate symptoms and signs related to heart failure. To further evaluate the therapeutic effect of Yiqi Fumai Injection on AHF, a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial that intends to recruit 1270 patients is being carried out in China. However, the mechanism of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF has not been clarified. To further explore~the underlying mechanism, we used~systematic pharmacology methods to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of biologically active compounds.                                         Methods               ~We used the databases of HERB, the Encyclopedia of Traditional Chinese Medicine (ETCM), the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), and GeneCards to predict the active ingredients and potential targets of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF. STRING was used for PPI network construction and analysis. Cytoscape was used to build a network between Chinese medicine, ingredients and targets. The DAVID, GO, and KEGG databases were used to predict the potential pathways of Yiqi Fumai Injection for the treatment of AHF.                                         Results               ~We obtained 31 active compounds of Yiqi Fumai Injection from HERB and ECTM databases. By overlapping targets between YQFMI and AHF, a total of 240 potential targets for Yiqi Fumai Injection to treat AHF were selected.~According to the H-C-T network topology analysis, the core compounds include beta-sitosterol, Uridine, Guanosine, and Stigmasterol. Sixteen protein targets had significantly higher node degrees than the average in the PPI network, including AKT1, JUN, TNF, EDN1, CASP3, ESR1, DLG4, PTGS2, NOS3, IL1B, C3, AR, LEP, CNR1, CHRM2, and DRD2. The PPI results showed that the potential therapeutic targets of YQFMI were densely enriched in pathways related to endothelial function, neuromodulation, and lipid metabolism.The same results were shown in GO and KEGG pathway enrichment.                                         Conclusion               ~Our results indicate that Yiqi Fumai Injection may achieve the goal of improving AHF-related symptoms by regulating the function of vascular endothelium and nerves and the biosynthetic pathway of lipid metabolism. These findings support previous studies and provide a reference for studying the mechanism of Yiqi Fumai Injection in the treatment of AHF. Abstract Figure.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential mechanism of EU-DR on OP through network pharmacology and molecular docking approaches.

The OP related targets were identified from the interactive web tool GEO2R. The shared targets were obtained by intersecting the targets of EU-DR and OP. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed via the STRING database and Cytoscape 3.7.2 software.

Sybyl-x 2.1.1 and Autodock Vina 1.1.2 software were used to cross validate the affinity between active compounds and target proteins. Our results showed that a total of 50 active compounds were screened, corresponding to 895 EU-DR targets, 2202 OP targets and 144 shared targets. The flavonoids in EU-DR played an important role in anti-OP. The enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG suggested EU-DR exerted a therapeutic effect on OP mainly by regulating the osteoclast differentiation related signaling pathway. Meanwhile, molecular docking results showed that most active compounds in EU-DR had strong binding efficiency to the target proteins. In conclusion, this study elaborated the multi-component, multi-target, and multi-pathway interaction mechanism of the EU-DR herbal pair in the treatment of OP for the first time, which also provided a pharmacological basis for treating OP.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eucommiae Cortex is a Chinese herbal medicine with bone protective effects and treats osteoporosis. This study aimed to explore the pharmacological  mechanisms of this complex mixture. METHODS: The active compounds and disease  targets involved in the study were obtained from publicly available websites and  databases. Core target genes were identified by protein-protein interaction (PPI)  network and topology analysis and mapped to critical components by a  "component-target" regulatory network. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes  (KEGG) Pathway analysis and Gene Ontology (GO)analysis were performed to analyze  the biological processes of target genes. Moreover, we carried out molecular  docking, cell experiments, and quantitative real-time PCR to propel the research  forward. RESULTS: Eucommiae Cortex contained 28 active ingredients and 85  potential targets for antiosteoporosis. PPI networks and topology analysis  screened 17 core target genes. The therapeutic mechanism involves a series of  biological reactions, including host-virus response, chemical stress, oxidative  stress, and cell cycle control. The KEGG enrichment illustrated that the MAPK  signaling pathway might play a significant role. The final experiment detected  ten genes (EGF, AKT1, JUN, MAPK8, MAPK1, CASP3, FOS, VEGFA, EGFR, and MYC) and  three compounds (quercetin, kaempferol, and beta- carotene) in the MAPK pathway.  Firstly, the CCK-8 and ALP activity test results showed that three compounds  could enhance the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1  cells. Secondly, molecular docking confirmed the favorable binding potential.  Subsequently, we observed that adding 1{${_\ast}$}10(-6)\,mol/L quercetin, 1{${_\ast}$}10(-5)\,\,mol/L  kaempferol, and 1{${_\ast}$}10(-5)\,\,mol/L beta-carotene activated the ERK/JNK cascades and  the heterodimer complex AP-1(Fos/Jun) in the MAPK pathway. CONCLUSION: MAPK  pathway might provide an essential mechanism for the antiosteoporosis effect of  Eucommiae Cortex. Eucommiae Cortex and its active ingredients have the potential  to treat osteoporosis.},

  abstract = {To achieve an effective deconstruction for preparation of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) and lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) from Eucommia ulmoides, a synergistic  pretreatment was successfully developed. Herein, the hemicelluloses were  preferentially dissociated in acetic acid-catalyzed hydrothermal pretreatment  (HTP) for preparation of XOS, and the hydrothermally-pretreated substrate was  then subjected to deep eutectic solvents (DES) delignification for fabrication of  LNPs. Results showed that the optimal yield (33.88\% based on xylan) of XOS is  obtained under the given HTP condition (170~\textdegree C, 0.5~h). NMR characterization  showed that the linkages of lignin were mainly composed of {$\beta$}-O-4, {$\beta$}-{$\beta$}, {$\beta$}-5, etc.  Besides, GPC analysis showed that the molecular weight of DES lignin fractions  was lower (1130-1200~g/mol) than those of corresponding parent lignin fractions  (8500-9620~g/mol). Further TEM characterization indicated that the optimal LNPs  fraction has a narrow size distribution and the corresponding size is ranged from  60 to 110~nm. In short, the synergistic pretreatment could be used as a green and  cost-effective approach for the development of bio-based chemicals and  biomaterials from Eucommia ulmoides biomass.},

  abstract = {Spermatogenesis directly determines the reproductive capacity of male animals. With the development of society, the increasing pressure on people's lives and  changes in the living environment, male fertility is declining. The leaf of  Eucommia ulmoides Oliv. (Eucommiae Folium, EF) was recorded in the 2020 Chinese  Pharmacopoeia and was used in traditional Chinese medicine as a tonic. In recent  years, EF has been reported to improve spermatogenesis, but the mechanisms of EF  remain was poorly characterized. In this study, the effect of EF ethanol extract  (EFEE) on spermatogenesis was tested in mice. Chemical components related to  spermatogenesis in EF were predicted by network pharmacology. The biological  activity of the predicted chemical components was measured by the proliferation  of C18-4 spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) and the testosterone secretion of TM3  leydig cells. The biological activity of chlorogenic acid (CGA), the active  compound in EF, was tested in vivo. The cell cycle was analysed by flow  cytometry. Testosterone secretion was detected by ELISA. RNA interference (RNAi)  was used to detect the effect of key genes on cell biological activity. Western  blotting, qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence staining were used to analyse the  molecular mechanism of related biological activities. The results showed that  EFEE and CGA could improve spermatogenesis in mice. Furthermore, the main  mechanism was that CGA promoted SSC proliferation, self-renewal and Leydig cell  testosterone secretion by promoting the expression of SHP2 and activating the  downstream signaling pathways involved in these biological processes. This study  provided strong evidence for elucidating the mechanism by which EF promotes the  spermatogenesis in mice and a new theoretical basis for dealing with the decrease  in male reproductive capacity.},

The SP ENMs with various EUOL@AgNPs loadings were  characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)  spectroscope, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy  (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and contact angle (CA)  measurements. The adsorption studies showed that the adsorption of Cd(II) and  Pb(II) was rapid, achieved equilibrium within 40~min and 60~min, respectively and  fitted with non-linear pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetics model. For Cd(II) and  Pb(II), the Freundlich model described the adsorption isotherm better than the  Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity for Cd(II) and Pb(II)  was 625 and 370.37~mg~g(-1) respectively at neutral pH. Coexisting anions of  fluoride, chloride, and nitrate had a negligible influence on Cd(II) removal than  the Pb(II). On the other hand, the presence of silicate and phosphate  considerably affected Cd(II) and Pb(II) adsorption. The recyclability,  regeneration, and reusability of the fabricated EUOL@AgNPs-SP ENMs were studied  and they retained their high adsorption capacity up to five cycles. The DFT  measurements revealed that SP-5 ENMs exhibited the highest adsorption selectivity  for Cd(II) and the measured binding energies for Cd(II), Pb(II), are 219.35 and  206.26~kcal~mol(-1), respectively. The developed ENM adsorbent may find  application for the removal of heavy metals from water.},

  abstract = {The research was conducted to elucidate the antibacterial performance and mode of action of Eucommia ulmoides male flower extract (EUMFE) against Staphylococcus  aureus and its application as a natural preservative in cooked beef. The  antibacterial activity was evaluated by determining the diameter of inhibition  zone (DIZ), minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericide  concentration (MBC). The changes in membrane potential, contents of bacterial DNA  and protein, integrity and permeability of the cell membrane, and cell morphology  were analyzed to reveal the possible mode of action. The effect of EUMFE on the  counts of S. aureus, pH, color, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), and  thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) of the cooked beef stored at 4\textdegree C  for 9 days were studied. The results showed that the DIZ, MIC, and MBC of EUMFE  against S. aureus were 12.58 {$\pm$} 0.23 mm, 40 mg/mL, and 80 mg/mL, respectively. The  mode of action of EUMFE against S. aureus included hyperpolarization of cell  membrane, decrease in bacterial DNA and protein contents, destruction of cell  membrane integrity, increase in cell membrane permeability, and damage of cell  morphology. After treatments with EUMFE, the growth of S. aureus and lipid  oxidation in cooked beef were significantly inhibited (P {$<$} 0.05). The pH and  TVB-N values of cooked beef treated with EUMFE were significantly reduced as  compared to control group (P {$<$} 0.05). The color of cooked beef samples containing  EUMFE showed decreased L* and b* values, and increased a* and {$\Delta$}E* values.  Therefore, our findings showed that EUMFE had a good antibacterial effect on S.  aureus, and provided a theoretical basis for the application of EUMFE as a  natural preservative in the preservation of cooked beef.},

(TT) drug pair in the treatment of hypertension-associated  neurovascular lesions and IS via the ferroptosis pathway. METHODS: We used the  Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform  to search for the key active compounds and targets of the drug pair. Based on the  GeneCards database, the relevant targets for the drug pair were obtained. Then,  we performed the molecular docking of the screened core active ingredients and  proteins using the DAVID database and the R AutoDock Vina software. Based on the  GSE22255 dataset, these screened target proteins were used to build random forest  (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) models. Finally, a new IS nomogram  prediction model was constructed and evaluated. RESULTS: There were 36 active  compounds in the EUO-TT drug pair. CHRM1, NR3C1, ADRB2, and OPRD1 proteins of the  neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway interacted with the proteins  related to the ferroptosis pathway. Molecular docking experiments identified 12  active ingredients of the drug pair that may tightly bind to those target  proteins. We constructed a visual IS nomogram prediction model using four genes  (CHRM1, NR3C1, ADRB2, and OPRD1). The calibration curve, DCA, and clinical impact  curves all indicated that the nomogram model is clinically applicable and  diagnostically capable. CHRM1, NR3C1, ADRB2, and OPRD1, the target genes of the  four effective components of the EUO-TT drug pair, were considered as risk  markers for IS. CONCLUSIONS: The active ingredients of EUO-TT drug pair may act  on proteins associated with the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway  to regulate ferroptosis in vascular neurons cells, ultimately affecting the onset  and progression of hypertension.},

  abstract = {Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a phenolic compound that is widely distributed in honeysuckle, Eucommia, fruits and vegetables. It has various biological  functions, including cardiovascular, nerve, kidney, and liver protection, and it  exerts a protective effect on human health, according to clinical research and  basic research. The intestine and brain are two important organs that are closely  related in the human body. The intestine is even called the "second brain" in  humans. However, among the many reports in the literature, an article  systematically reporting the regulatory effects and specific mechanisms of CGA on  the intestines and brain has not been published. In this context, this review  uses the regulatory role and mechanism of CGA in the intestine and brain as the  starting point and comprehensively reviews CGA metabolism in the body and the  regulatory role and mechanism of CGA in the intestine and brain described in  recent years. Additionally, the review speculates on the potential biological  actions of CGA in the gut-brain axis. This study provides a scientific theory for  CGA research in the brain and intestines and promotes the transformation of basic  research and the application of CGA in food nutrition and health care.},

The morphology of the CNT/GNP hybrids in the  CNT/GNP/EUG composites showed the uniform distribution of CNTs and GNPs in EUG,  forming a denser filler network, which afforded improved conductivity and EMI  shielding effect compared with pure EUG. Accordingly, EMI shielding effectiveness  values of the CNT/GNP/EUG composites reached 42 dB in the X-band frequency range,  meeting the EMI shielding requirements for commercial products. Electromagnetic  waves were mainly absorbed via conduction losses, multiple reflections from  interfaces and interfacial dipole relaxation losses. Moreover, the CNT/GNP/EUG  composites exhibited attractive mechanical properties and high thermal stability.  The combination of excellent EMI shielding performance and attractive mechanical  properties render the as-prepared CNT/GNP/EUG composites attractive candidates  for various applications.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In this study, the combination of Eucommia ulmoides-Tribulus terrestris (EU-TT) was used to intervene in aging spontaneously hypertensive rats  (SHRs). Quantitative proteomics sequencing was performed to screen the targets of  EU-TT, so as to provide data support for the clinical application of EU-TT.  METHODS: Eighteen-month-old SHRs were administered EU-TT (5.53 g/kg/day)  intragastrically for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was recorded to evaluate the  efficacy of EU-TT in vivo. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and  hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining were used to assess the morphology of the  hypothalamus. The label free proteomics assay was performed to screen the targets  of EU-TT in hypertensive hypothalami. ERK, JNK, and p38 were chosen for Reverse  Transcription-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blot.  RESULTS: After 8 weeks of treatment, EU-TT effectively decreased systolic blood  pressure (SBP) by 19.2 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 8.6 mmHg  (P{$<$}0.05), and improved the hypothalamus morphology of aging SHRs. Label free  proteomics identified 248 differentially expressed (DE) proteins (157 were  upregulated and 91 were downregulated) in the hypothalamus after EU-TT treatment.  Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis suggested that  EU-TT regulated the MAPK signal transduction pathway, which was also confirmed by  RT-qPCR and Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: EU-TT steadily decreased the SBP and DBP  of aging SHRs, and improved the morphology of the hypothalamus, which was  pharmacologically related to the MAPK signaling pathway.

Channel catfish fed three diets, including a  high-fat diet (11\% crude fat) and ELE-supplemented diets containing 1\textperthousand{} or 2\textperthousand{} ELE  for 4 weeks. The results showed the contents of liver triacylglycerol of 1\textperthousand{} and  2\textperthousand{} ELE groups were reduced, and ELE treatments decreased the expression of  lipogenesis related genes (srebp-1c, ppar{$\gamma$}, and acc-1), and increased the  expression of lipolysis related genes (ppar{$\alpha$}). In addition, the supplementation  of ELE improved the inflammatory response of the liver and intestine. ELE could  improve the destruction of intestinal morphology structure and increase the  expression level of hif-1a and tight junction proteins (Occludin, Claudin2,  Claudin15). 2\textperthousand{} ELE significantly enhanced the antioxidant capacity of intestine  by increasing the activity of SOD enzyme. Moreover, the supplement of ELE  significantly increased the abundance of Cetobacterium and Romboutsia (p~{$<~$}0.05).  Compared with the control group, the expression of immune factor nf-{$\kappa$}b had a  significant decrease, and il-1{$\beta$} showed a tendency to decrease in the ELE  supplement groups after pathogenic bacteria challenge. In conclusion, the ELE  alleviated fatty liver disease and inflammation response, improved the oxidative  capacity and physiological structure of intestine, and improved the structure of  intestinal microbiota and disease resistance in HFD-fed channel catfish.},

  abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eucommia ulmoides Oliver has been traditionally used for treatment of various diseases, including osteoporosis, knee pain, and  paralysis. The extract of Eucommia ulmoides has been reported to stimulate the  bone formation and suppress the bone resorption, leading to protection against  osteoporosis (OP). Geniposide (GEN) has been considered as one of the effective  compounds responsible for the therapeutic efficacy of Eucommia ulmoides against  OP. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore whether GEN protected against dexamethasone  (DEX)-induced osteoporosis (OP) by activating NRF2 expression and inhibiting  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The DEX-induced rat OP  models were duplicated. The pathological changes were examined by  histological/immunohistochemical evaluation and micro-computed tomography  (micro-CT) assessment. Apoptosis was detected by a flow cytometer. Mitochondrial  Ca(2+) concentrations and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected. Western  blot assays were used to detect the protein expression. RESULTS: GEN effectively  reversed DEX-induced pathological changes of trabecular bone in rats. In  addition, the DEX-increased expression of ATF4/CHOP was also ameliorated. In  MC3T3-E1 cells, DEX promoted endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial  apoptosis. Inhibition of ER stress abolished the induction of apoptosis by DEX.  Similarly, GEN significantly ameliorated DEX-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. The  possible underlying mechanism might be associated with the pharmacological  effects of GEN on activating the expression of NRF2 and alleviating ER stress in  DEX-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. CONCLUSION: GEN ameliorated DEX-induced ER stress and  mitochondrial apoptosis in osteoblasts.},

After 8~weeks,  there were no significant differences between the placebo and treatment legs for  the change in subcutaneous fat thickness of the front thigh (p~=~0.73) or for leg  fat percentage (p~=~0.52). However, there was a slight, yet significant  difference in the change in subcutaneous fat thickness of the lateral thigh  favoring the treatment leg (-0.42 vs +0.75~mm, p~=~0.029), but with this  difference disappearing depending on the statistical tests being used. Only 2/19  participants perceived a difference in fat loss in response to each condition.  Although the topical lotion tested here resulted in statistically significantly  greater subcutaneous fat loss at the lateral but not front thigh, this effect was  very small, contingent upon the statistical test being used, and unperceivable by  the participants themselves.},

However, the genetic diversity and population structure of E.  ulmoides are~still ~ambiguous nowdays. In this study, we re-sequenced the genomes  of 12 E. ulmoides accessions from different major climatic geography regions in  China to elucidate the genetic diversity, population structure and evolutionary  pattern. By integration of phylogenetic analysis, principal component analysis  and population structure analysis based on a number of high-quality SNPs, a total  of 12 E. ulmoides accessions were clustered into four different groups. This  result is consistent with their geographical location except for group samples  from Shanghai and Hunan province. E. ulmoides accessions from Hunan province  exhibited a closer genetic relationship with E. ulmoides accessions from Shanghai  in China compared with other regions, which is also supported by the result of  population structure analyses. Genetic diversity analysis further revealed that  E. ulmoides samples in Shanghai and Hunan province were with higher genetic  diversity than those in other regions in this study. In addition, we treated the  E. ulmoides materials from Shanghai and Hunan province as group A, and the other  materials from other places as group B, and then analyzed the evolutionary  pattern of E. ulmoides. The result showed the significant differentiation  (Fst\,=\,0.1545) between group A and group B. Some candidate highly divergent  genome regions were identified in group A by selective sweep analyses, and the  function analysis of candidate genes in these regions showed that biological  regulation processes could be correlated with the Eu-rubber biosynthesis.  Notably, nine genes were identified from selective sweep regions. They were  involved in the Eu-rubber biosynthesis and expressed in rubber containing  tissues. The genetic diversity research and evolution model of E. ulmoides were  preliminarily explored in this study, which laid the foundation for the  protection of germplasm resources and the development and utilization of  multipurpose germplasm resources in the future.},

The  laccase activity, resistance to Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea) and lignin level in  wild-type and transgenic plants were thereafter investigated. Interestingly, the  transgenic tobacco displayed a significantly higher laccase activity and  resistance to gray mold as compared to the wild-type tobacco. Additionally, the  lignin contents in the leaves and stems of the transgenic tobacco were  significantly higher in comparison to the wild-type tobacco. Scanning electron  microscopy was used to observe the cross sections of wild-type and transgenic  tobacco stems and it was noted that the cell wall near the xylem catheter of the  transgenic tobacco was substantially thicker and the outline clearer than that of  the wild-type. Thus, the EuLAC1 gene can significantly increase laccase activity  and lignin content in tobacco, leading to an increase in the physical defenses,  thereby increasing tobacco resistance to gray mold.},

Polysaccharides cannot be simply sequenced because they are often highly branched and lack a uniform structure. Furthermore, large polymeric structures cannot be directly analyzed by mass spectrometry techniques, a problem that has been solved for polynucleotides and proteins. While restriction enzymes have advanced genomic analysis, and trypsin has advanced proteomic analysis, there has been no equivalent enzyme for universal polysaccharide digestion. We describe the development and application of a chemical method for producing oligosaccharides from polysaccharides. The released oligosaccharides are characterized by advanced liquid chromatography\textendash mass spectrometry (LC\textendash MS) methods with high sensitivity, accuracy and throughput. The technique is first used to identify polysaccharides by oligosaccharide fingerprinting. Next, the polysaccharide compositions of food and feces are determined, further illustrating the utility of technique in food and clinical studies.},

  abstract = {A toxicogenomics approach was used to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the gene expression changes in human and rat primary hepatocytes exposed to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Hepatocytes from five individual rats and five individual humans were exposed for 24 h to 11 concentrations of TCDD ranging from 0.00001 to 100nM and a vehicle control. Gene expression changes were analyzed using whole-genome microarrays containing 13,002 orthologs. Significant changes in expression of individual orthologs at any concentration (fold change [FC] {$\pm$} 1.5 and false discovery rate {$<$} 0.05) were higher in the rat (1547) compared with human hepatocytes (475). Only 158 differentially expressed orthologs were common between rats and humans. Enrichment analysis was performed on the differentially expressed orthologs in each species with 49 and 34 enriched human and rat pathways, respectively. Only 12 enriched pathways were shared between the two species. The results demonstrate significant cross-species differences in expression at both the gene and pathway level. Benchmark dose analysis of gene expression changes showed an average 18-fold cross-species difference in potency among differentially expressed orthologs with the rat more sensitive than the human. Similar cross-species differences in potency were observed for signaling pathways. Using the maximum FC in gene expression as a measure of efficacy, the human hepatocytes showed on average a 20\% lower efficacy among the individual orthologs showing differential expression. The results provide evidence for divergent cross-species gene expression changes in response to TCDD and are consistent with epidemiological and clinical evidence showing humans to be less sensitive to TCDD-induced hepatotoxicity.},

However, investigation into potential ARNT isoform\textendash specific immune functions is lacking despite the well-established heterodimerization requirement of ARNT with, and for the activity of, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a critical mediator of immune homeostasis. Here, using global and targeted transcriptomics analyses, we show that the relative ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio in human T cell lymphoma cells dictates the amplitude and direction of AhR target gene regulation. Specifically, shifting the ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio lower by suppressing isoform 1 enhances, or higher by suppressing isoform 3 abrogates, AhR responsiveness to ligand activation through preprograming a cellular genetic background that directs explicit gene expression patterns. Moreover, the fluctuations in gene expression patterns that accompany a decrease or increase in the ARNT isoform 1:3 ratio are associated with inflammation or immunosuppression, respectively. Molecular studies identified the unique casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation site within isoform 1 as an essential parameter to the mechanism of ARNT isoform\textendash specific regulation of AhR signaling. Notably, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of ARNT isoform 1 is dependent on ligand-induced AhR nuclear translocation and is required for optimal AhR target gene regulation. These observations reveal ARNT as a central modulator of AhR activity predicated on the status of the ARNT isoform ratio and suggest that ARNT-based therapies are a viable option for tuning the immune system to target immune disorders.},

Global detection and identification of nontargeted components are desirable in natural product research, for example, in quality control of Chinese herbal medicine. Nontargeted components analysis continues to expand to exciting life science application domains such as metabonomics. With this background, the present review summarizes recent developments in the analysis of minor unknown natural products using LC-MS and mainly focuses on the determination of the molecular formulae, selection of precursor ions, and characteristic fragmentation patterns of the known compounds. This review consists of three parts. Firstly, the methods used to determine unique molecular formula of unknown compounds such as accurate mass measurements, MSn spectra, or relative isotopic abundance information, are introduced. Secondly, the methods improving signal-to-noise ratio of MS/MS spectra by manual-MS/MS or workflow targeting-only signals were elucidated; pure precursor ions can be selected by changing the precursor ion isolated window. Lastly, characteristic fragmentation patterns such as Retro-Diels-Alder (RDA), McLafferty rearrangements, "internal residue loss," and so on, occurring in the molecular ions of natural products are summarized. Classical application of characteristic fragmentation patterns in identifying unknown compounds in extracts and relevant fragmentation mechanisms are presented (RDA reactions occurring readily in the molecular ions of flavanones or isoflavanones, McLafferty-type fragmentation reactions of some natural products such as epipolythiodioxopiperazines; fragmentation by "internal residue loss" possibly involving ion-neutral complex intermediates). \textcopyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {An important mechanism by which IFN-{$\gamma$} primes macrophages for enhanced innate immune responses is abrogation of feedback inhibitory pathways. Accordingly, IFN-{$\gamma$} abrogates endotoxin tolerance, a major negative feedback loop that silences expression of inflammatory cytokine genes in macrophages previously exposed to endotoxin/Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands. Mechanisms by which IFN-{$\gamma$} inhibits endotoxin tolerance have not been elucidated. Here, we show that pretreatment with IFN-{$\gamma$} prevented tolerization of primary human monocytes and restored TLR4-mediated induction of various proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF{$\alpha$}. Surprisingly, IFN-{$\gamma$} did not alter proximal TLR4 signaling defects in tolerized monocytes. Instead, IFN-{$\gamma$} blocked tolerance-associated down-regulation of               IL6               and               TNF               transcription, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and NF-{$\kappa$}B and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein {$\beta$} transcription factor binding to the               IL6               and               TNF               promoters in tolerized monocytes. The mechanism by which IFN-{$\gamma$} restored               IL6               expression was by facilitating TLR4-induced recruitment of chromatin remodeling machinery to the               IL6               promoter and promoting               IL6               locus accessibility in tolerized monocytes. Our results suggest that IFN-{$\gamma$} overcomes endotoxin tolerance by facilitating TLR-induced chromatin remodeling to allow expression of proinflammatory genes. These results identify a mechanism by which IFN-{$\gamma$} promotes activation of macrophages and highlight the importance of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional control in the regulation of inflammatory cytokine production in tolerant and activated macrophages.},

  abstract = {In the past decade, advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have revolutionized untargeted metabolomics analyses. By mining metabolomes more deeply, researchers are now primed to uncover key metabolites and their associations with diseases. The employment of untargeted metabolomics has led to new biomarker discoveries and a better mechanistic understanding of diseases with applications in precision medicine. However, many major pertinent challenges remain. First, compound identification has been poor, and left an overwhelming number of unidentified peaks. Second, partial, incomplete metabolomes persist due to factors such as limitations in mass spectrometry data acquisition speeds, wide-range of metabolites concentrations, and cellular/tissue/temporal-specific expression changes that confound our understanding of metabolite perturbations. Third, to contextualize metabolites in pathways and biology is difficult because many metabolites partake in multiple pathways, have yet to be described species specificity, or possess unannotated or more-complex functions that are not easily characterized through metabolomics analyses. From a translational perspective, information related to novel metabolite biomarkers, metabolic pathways, and drug targets might be sparser than they should be. Thankfully, significant progress has been made and novel solutions are emerging, achieved through sustained academic and industrial community efforts in terms of hardware, computational, and experimental approaches. Given the rapidly growing utility of metabolomics, this review will offer new perspectives, increase awareness of the major challenges in LC-MS metabolomics that will significantly benefit the metabolomics community and also the broader the biomedical community metabolomics aspire to serve.},

We use the fragmentation tree to predict the molecular structure fingerprint of the unknown compound using machine learning.

  abstract = {Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to cartilage destruction and bone erosion. In-depth exploration of the pathogenesis of RA and the development of effective therapeutic drugs are of important clinical and social value. Herein, we explored the medicinal value of Cornus officinalis Sieb. and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. in RA treatment using a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). We compared the therapeutic effect of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia lactiflora with that of their main active compounds, ursolic acid and paeoniflorin, respectively. We demonstrated that the combination of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia lactiflora effectively inhibited the release of factors associated with oxidative stress and inflammation during RA, therein ameliorating the symptoms and suppressing the progression of RA. We further showed that the underlying mechanisms may be related to the regulation of apoptosis in synovial tissues, and we investigated the potential involvement of AMPK-mediated mitochondrial dynamics in the therapeutic action of the two drugs and their active components.},

  abstract = {Meniscus plays an important role in joint homeostasis. Tear or degeneration of meniscus might facilitate the process of knee osteoarthritis (OA). Hence, to investigate the transcriptome change during meniscus degeneration, we reveal the alterations of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA) in meniscus during OA by whole-transcriptome sequence. A total of 375 mRNAs, 15 miRNAs, 56 lncRNAs, and 90 circRNAs were significantly altered in the degenerative meniscus treated with interleukin-1{$\beta$} (IL-1{$\beta$}). More importantly, highly specific co-expression RNA (ceRNA) networks regulated by lncRNA LOC107986251-miR-212-5p-SESN3 and hsa\_circ\_0018069-miR-147b-3p-TJP2 were screened out during IL-induced meniscus degeneration, unveiling potential therapeutic targets for meniscus degeneration during the OA process. Furthermore, lipocalin-2 (LCN2) and RAB27B were identified as potential biomarkers in meniscus degeneration by overlapping three previously constructed databases of OA menisci. LCN2 and RAB27B were both upregulated in osteoarthritic menisci and IL-1{$\beta$}-treated menisci and were highly associated with the severity of OA. This could introduce potential novel molecules into the database of clinical diagnostic biomarkers and possible therapeutic targets for early-stage OA treatment.},

However, their identification has long been a challenge even with the state-of-the-art analysis technologies like high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) due to their complexity. Emerging               in silico               chemical structure prediction tools have provided time-saving and highly efficient approaches for identification of these complex samples. Nevertheless, the interpretation of these MS annotations into key supporting evidence towards specific questions is still a bottleneck in medicinal and biological fields. Here we present a deep clustering-based MS data visualization strategy (MCnebula), integrated with the influential open-source automatic MS annotation platform SIRIUS and               in vivo               and               in vitro               methods, to screen and validate potential lead compounds from natural products. MCnebula could provide multi-layer clustering profiles with chemical ontologies and comparative analysis of differential treatments. Plantaginis Semen (PS) is commonly used for treating kidney disease and usually stir-fried with salt water to enhance its anti-renal fibrosis effect, but the reason behind this remains unclear. Taking PS as an example, we comprehensively identified and compared the raw and processed PS extracts with SIRIUS-MCnebula, and screened potential anti-renal fibrotic lead compounds using weighted fold change analysis. Eighty-nine components were identified in PS with isoacteoside, calceolarioside B, 2{${'}$}-acetylacteoside, and plantainoside D being screened and validated to treat renal fibrosis. The novel developed mass spectral data visualization strategy combined with biological function investigation and validation workflow could not only accelerate the discovery of lead compounds from medicinal natural products, but also shed new light on the traditional processing theory.},

  abstract = {Differential expression analysis of genomic data types, such as RNA-sequencing experiments, use linear models to determine the size and direction of the changes in gene expression. For RNA-sequencing, there are several established software packages for this purpose accompanied with analysis pipelines that are well described. However, there are two crucial steps in the analysis process that can be a stumbling block for many -- the set up an appropriate model via design matrices and the set up of comparisons of interest via contrast matrices. These steps are particularly troublesome because an extensive catalogue for design and contrast matrices does not currently exist. One would usually search for example case studies across different platforms and mix and match the advice from those sources to suit the dataset they have at hand. This article guides the reader through the basics of how to set up design and contrast matrices. We take a practical approach by providing code and graphical representation of each case study, starting with simpler examples (e.g. models with a single explanatory variable) and move onto more complex ones (e.g. interaction models, mixed effects models, higher order time series and cyclical models). Although our work has been written specifically with a               limma               -style pipeline in mind, most of it is also applicable to other software packages for differential expression analysis, and the ideas covered can be adapted to data analysis of other high-throughput technologies. Where appropriate, we explain the interpretation and differences between models to aid readers in their own model choices. Unnecessary jargon and theory is omitted where possible so that our work is accessible to a wide audience of readers, from beginners to those with experience in genomics data analysis.},

Zucc and Paeonia lactiflora Pall. have exhibited favorable therapeutic effects against rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the specific mechanisms of their active compounds remain unclear. The aim of this study was to comprehensively analyze the therapeutic mechanisms of selected active compounds in Cornus officinalis (loganin, ursolic acid, and morroniside) and Paeonia lactiflora (paeoniflorin and albiflorin) via network pharmacology. The pharmacological properties of the five active compounds were evaluated and their potential target genes were identified by database screening. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional analysis were performed to determine the enriched molecular pathways associated with the active compounds. Using network pharmacology tools, eight genes (IL1{$\beta$}, VEGFA, STAT3, TP53, IL6, TNF, FOS, and LGALS3) were identified as common targets between RA and the five active compounds. Molecular docking simulation revealed the compound-target relationship between the five active compounds and three selected targets from the eight common ones (LGALS3, STAT3, and VEGFA). The compound-target relationships were subsequently validated via preliminary               in vivo               experiments in a rat model of collagen-induced arthritis. Rats subjected to collagen-induced arthritis showed increased protein expression of LGALS3, STAT3, and VEGFA in synovial tissues. However, treatment using Cornus officinalis or/and Paeonia lactiflora, as well as their most drug-like active compounds (ursolic acid or/and paeoniflorin, respectively, identified based on pharmacological properties), attenuated the expression of these three targets, as previously predicted. Collectively, network pharmacology allowed the pharmacological and molecular roles of Cornus officinalis and Paeonia lactiflora to be systematically revealed, further establishing them as important candidate drugs in the treatment and management of RA.},

Here, we develop an ion mobility-mass spectrometry based four-dimensional sterolomics technology leveraged by a machine learning-empowered high-coverage library ({$>$}2000 sterol lipids) for accurate identification. We apply this four-dimensional technology to profile the spatially resolved landscapes of sterol lipids in ten functional regions of the mouse brain, and quantitatively uncover \textasciitilde 200 sterol lipids uniquely distributed in specific regions with concentrations spanning up to 8 orders of magnitude. Further spatial analysis pinpoints age-associated differences in region-specific sterol lipid metabolism, revealing changes in the numbers of altered sterol lipids, concentration variations, and age-dependent coregulation networks. These findings will contribute to our understanding of abnormal sterol lipid metabolism and its role in brain diseases.},

DIA data mining heavily relies on a spectral library that in most cases is built on DDA analysis of the same sample. Construction of this project-specific DDA library impairs the analytical throughput, limits the proteome coverage, and increases the sample size for DIA phosphoproteomics. Herein we introduce a deep neural network, DeepPhospho, which conceptually differs from previous deep learning models to achieve accurate predictions of LC-MS/MS data for phosphopeptides. By leveraging in silico libraries generated by DeepPhospho, we establish a DIA workflow for phosphoproteome profiling which involves DIA data acquisition and data mining with DeepPhospho predicted libraries, thus circumventing the need of DDA library construction. Our DeepPhospho-empowered workflow substantially expands the phosphoproteome coverage while maintaining high quantification performance, which leads to the discovery of more signaling pathways and regulated kinases in an EGF signaling study than the DDA library-based approach. DeepPhospho is provided as a web server as well as an offline app to facilitate user access to model training, predictions and library generation.},

  pages = {18},
  abstract = {Empirical Bayes is a statistical approach for estimating a series of unknown parameters from a series of associated data observations. It provides an effective means to ``borrow strength'' from the ensemble of cases when making inference about each individual case. Such methods are ideally suited to genomic applications where data is collected for tens of thousands of genes simultaneously. Empirical Bayes methods can however be less effective when highly exceptional cases are present. This article proposes a practical solution whereby exceptional cases are identified and the amount of ``learning'' from the ensemble appropriate for each case is assessed on a case-specific basis. The approach is developed in detail for the problem of estimating genewise variances from microarray data. In this context, the proposed robust empirical Bayes procedure recognizes and protects against hyper-variable genes. The new procedure improves statistical power for most genes in many microarray data sets. Simulations show that the robust estimation procedure correctly controls the type I error rate and does not increase the number of false discoveries when no hyper-variable genes are present. In the presence of hyper-variable genes, the robust method improves power to detect differential expression for the majority of genes that are not outliers. The proposed robust method is applied to an example microarray data set, on which it correctly identifies and downweights genes associated with a hidden covariate and detects more genes likely to be scientifically relevant to the experimental conditions. The new procedure is implemented in the limma software package which is freely available from the Bioconductor repository.},

  abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

Current computational methods show high sensitivity to custom parameterization, which leads to inconsistent performance on different molecular data. Our new method, MoSBi (molecular signature identification using biclustering), 1) enables so far unmatched high performance for stratification and subtyping across datasets of various different biomolecules, 2) provides a scalable solution for visualizing the results and their correspondence to clinical factors, and 3) has immediate practical relevance through its automatic workflow where individual selection, parameterization, screening, and visualization of biclustering algorithms is not required. MoSBi is a major step forward with a high impact for clinical and wet-lab researchers.           ,              The improving access to increasing amounts of biomedical data provides completely new chances for advanced patient stratification and disease subtyping strategies. This requires computational tools that produce uniformly robust results across highly heterogeneous molecular data. Unsupervised machine learning methodologies are able to discover de novo patterns in such data. Biclustering is especially suited by simultaneously identifying sample groups and corresponding feature sets across heterogeneous omics data. The performance of available biclustering algorithms heavily depends on individual parameterization and varies with their application. Here, we developed MoSBi (molecular signature identification using biclustering), an automated multialgorithm ensemble approach that integrates results utilizing an error model-supported similarity network. We systematically evaluated the performance of 11 available and established biclustering algorithms together with MoSBi. For this, we used transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data, as well as synthetic datasets covering various data properties. Profiting from multialgorithm integration, MoSBi identified robust group and disease-specific signatures across all scenarios, overcoming single algorithm specificities. Furthermore, we developed a scalable network-based visualization of bicluster communities that supports biological hypothesis generation. MoSBi is available as an R package and web service to make automated biclustering analysis accessible for application in molecular sample stratification.},

This study aimed to evaluate the differentiation effect of AhR antagonist in PTC, and to explore the potential mechanism of it. Results showed that AhR antagonists promoted differentiation of PTC, as shown as increase in 125I uptake and Na/I symporter (NIS) expression level. CircRNA microarray in K1 cells treated with StemRegenin 1(SR1) revealed that hsa\_circ\_0006741 (circSH2B3) was down-regulated in SR1 treated K1 cells. Downregulation of circSH2B3 increased 125I uptake and NIS expression levels. CircSH2B3 acted as an endogenous sponge of hsa-miR-4640-5p and modulated IGF2BP2 expression. IGF2BP2 overexpression induced dedifferentiation of PTC, while silencing IGF2BP2 accelerated differentiation of PTC cells. Rescue studies showed that the dedifferentiation activity of AhR was modulated by the circSH2B3/miR-4640-5p/IGF2BP2 axis. Our findings confirmed for the first time that AhR antagonists promote differentiation of PTC via inhibiting the circSH2B3/miR-4640-5p/IGF2BP2 axis, offering a novel therapeutic approach and a potential marker for differentiation of PTC.},

Whole-genome transcriptomics yielded a list of regulated genes by Rank Product statistics and DAVID was then used for functional annotation enrichment analysis. Last, data were validated by qRT-PCR. Abatacept, tocilizumab and anti-TNFa cohorts were separately compared with methotrexate, leading to the identification of 78, 6, and 436 differentially expressed genes, respectively. The upper-most ranked genes were related to inflammatory processes and immune responses. Such an approach draws the genomic profile of monocytes in treated RA patients and lays the basis for finding gene signature for tailored therapeutic choices.},

To address these, we synthesized and analyzed {$>$}300,000 peptides by multi-modal LC-MS/MS within the ProteomeTools project representing HLA class I \& II ligands and products of the proteases AspN and LysN. The resulting data enabled training of a single model using the deep learning framework Prosit, allowing the accurate prediction of fragment ion spectra for tryptic and non-tryptic peptides. Applying Prosit demonstrates that the identification of HLA peptides can be improved up to 7-fold, that 87\% of the proposed proteasomally spliced HLA peptides may be incorrect and that dozens of additional immunogenic neo-epitopes can be identified from patient tumors in published data. Together, the provided peptides, spectra and computational tools substantially expand the analytical depth of immunopeptidomics workflows.},

The final probabilistic result allows the user to make a final decision about which points in a chromatogram are affected by a chromatographic peak and which ones are only affected by noise. The use of probabilities contrasts with the traditional method in which a binary answer is given, relying on a threshold. By contrast, with the Bayesian peak detection presented here, the values of probability can be further propagated into other preprocessing steps, which will increase (or decrease) the importance of chromatographic regions into the final results. The present work is based on the use of the statistical overlap theory of component overlap from Davis and Giddings (Davis, J. M.; Giddings, J. Anal. Chem. 1983, 55, 418-424) as prior probability in the Bayesian formulation. The algorithm was tested on LC-MS Orbitrap data and was able to successfully distinguish chemical noise from actual peaks without any data preprocessing.},

  abstract = {Optical chemical structure recognition from scientific publications is essential for rediscovering a chemical structure. It is an extremely challenging problem, and current rule-based and deep-learning methods cannot achieve satisfactory recognition rates. Herein, we propose SwinOCSR, an end-to-end model based on a Swin Transformer. This model uses the Swin Transformer as the backbone to extract image features and introduces Transformer models to convert chemical information from publications into DeepSMILES. A novel chemical structure dataset was constructed to train and verify our method. Our proposed Swin Transformer-based model was extensively tested against the backbone of existing publicly available deep learning methods. The experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the compared methods, demonstrating the model's effectiveness. Moreover, we used a focal loss to address the token imbalance problem in the text representation of the chemical structure diagram, and our model achieved an accuracy of 98.58\%.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Peak detection is a key step in the preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data generated from high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The common practice is to use filters with predetermined parameters to select peaks in the LC/MS profile. This rigid approach can cause suboptimal performance when the choice of peak model and parameters do not suit the data characteristics.             Results: Here we present a method that learns directly from various data features of the extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) to differentiate between true peak regions from noise regions in the LC/MS profile. It utilizes the knowledge of known metabolites, as well as robust machine learning approaches. Unlike currently available methods, this new approach does not assume a parametric peak shape model and allows maximum flexibility. We demonstrate the superiority of the new approach using real data. Because matching to known metabolites entails uncertainties and cannot be considered a gold standard, we also developed a probabilistic receiver-operating characteristic (pROC) approach that can incorporate uncertainties.             Availability and implementation: The new peak detection approach is implemented as part of the apLCMS package available at http://web1.sph.emory.edu/apLCMS/             Contact: ~tyu8@emory.edu             Supplementary information: ~Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               In order to correctly decode phenotypic information from RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data, careful selection of the RNA-seq quantification measure is critical for inter-sample comparisons and for downstream analyses, such as differential gene expression between two or more conditions. Several methods have been proposed and continue to be used. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the best gene expression quantification method for RNA-seq data analysis.                                         Methods               In the present study, we used replicate samples from each of 20 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models spanning 15 tumor types, for a total of 61 human tumor xenograft samples available through the NCI patient-derived model repository (PDMR). We compared the reproducibility across replicate samples based on TPM (transcripts per million), FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped), and normalized counts using coefficient of variation, intraclass correlation coefficient, and cluster analysis.                                         Results               Our results revealed that hierarchical clustering on normalized count data tended to group replicate samples from the same PDX model together more accurately than TPM and FPKM data. Furthermore, normalized count data were observed to have the lowest median coefficient of variation (CV), and highest intraclass correlation (ICC) values across all replicate samples from the same model and for the same gene across all PDX models compared to TPM and FPKM data.                                         Conclusion               We provided compelling evidence for a preferred quantification measure to conduct downstream analyses of PDX RNA-seq data. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of RNA-seq data quantification measures conducted on PDX models, which are known to be inherently more variable than cell line models. Our findings are consistent with what others have shown for human tumors and cell lines and add further support to the thesis that normalized counts are the best choice for the analysis of RNA-seq data across samples.},
